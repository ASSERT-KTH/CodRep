	 * ToDo test cases
	 * 1)Use a parameter as cast operand and cast that to character type. The
	 * resultant type should get it's collation from the compilation schema
	 * 2)Test conditional if (NULLIF and CASE) with different datatypes to see
	 * how casting works. The compile node for this SQL construct seems to be
	 * dealing with lot of casting code (ConditionalNode)
	 * 3)When doing concatenation testing, check what happens if concatantion
	 * is between non-char types. This is because ConcatenationOperatorNode
	 * in compile package has following comment "If either the left or right 
	 * operands are non-string, non-bit types, then we generate an implicit 
	 * cast to VARCHAR."
	 * 4)Do testing with upper and lower
	 * 5)It looks like node for LIKE ESCAPE which is LikeEscapeOperatorNode
	 * also uses quite a bit of casting. Should include test for LIKE ESCAPE
	 * which will trigger the casting.
	 * 6)Binary arithmetic operators do casting if one of the operands is
	 * string and other is numeric. Test that combination
	 * 7)Looks like import utility does casting (in ColumnInfo class). See
	 * if any testing is required for that.
	 * 8)Do testing with UNION and use the results of UNION in collation
	 * comparison (if there is something like that possible. I didn't put too
	 * much thought into it but wanted to list here so we can do the required
	 * testing if needed).
