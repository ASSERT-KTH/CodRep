/*
 * Commit Log tracks every write operation into the system. The aim
 * of the commit log is to be able to successfully recover data that was
 * not stored to disk via the Memtable. Every Commit Log maintains a
 * header represented by the abstraction CommitLogHeader. The header
 * contains a bit array and an array of longs and both the arrays are
 * of size, #column families for the Table, the Commit Log represents.
 *
 * Whenever a ColumnFamily is written to, for the first time its bit flag
 * is set to one in the CommitLogHeader. When it is flushed to disk by the
 * Memtable its corresponding bit in the header is set to zero. This helps
 * track which CommitLogs can be thrown away as a result of Memtable flushes.
 * Additionally, when a ColumnFamily is flushed and written to disk, its
 * entry in the array of longs is updated with the offset in the Commit Log
 * file where it was written. This helps speed up recovery since we can seek
 * to these offsets and start processing the commit log.
 *
 * Every Commit Log is rolled over everytime it reaches its threshold in size;
 * the new log inherits the "dirty" bits from the old.
 *
 * Over time there could be a number of commit logs that would be generated.
 * To allow cleaning up non-active commit logs, whenever we flush a column family and update its bit flag in
 * the active CL, we take the dirty bit array and bitwise & it with the headers of the older logs.
 * If the result is 0, then it is safe to remove the older file.  (Since the new CL
 * inherited the old's dirty bitflags, getting a zero for any given bit in the anding
 * means that either the CF was clean in the old CL or it has been flushed since the
 * switch in the new.)
