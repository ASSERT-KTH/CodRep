/**
 * A {@link Filter} that only accepts documents whose single
 * term value in the specified field is contained in the
 * provided set of allowed terms.
 * 
 * <p/>
 * 
 * This is the same functionality as TermsFilter (from
 * contrib/queries), except this filter requires that the
 * field contains only a single term for all documents.
 * Because of drastically different implementations, they
 * also have different performance characteristics, as
 * described below.
 * 
 * <p/>
 * 
 * The first invocation of this filter on a given field will
 * be slower, since a {@link FieldCache.DocTermsIndex} must be
 * created.  Subsequent invocations using the same field
 * will re-use this cache.  However, as with all
 * functionality based on {@link FieldCache}, persistent RAM
 * is consumed to hold the cache, and is not freed until the
 * {@link IndexReader} is closed.  In contrast, TermsFilter
 * has no persistent RAM consumption.
 * 
 * 
 * <p/>
 * 
 * With each search, this filter translates the specified
 * set of Terms into a private {@link OpenBitSet} keyed by
 * term number per unique {@link IndexReader} (normally one
 * reader per segment).  Then, during matching, the term
 * number for each docID is retrieved from the cache and
 * then checked for inclusion using the {@link OpenBitSet}.
 * Since all testing is done using RAM resident data
 * structures, performance should be very fast, most likely
 * fast enough to not require further caching of the
 * DocIdSet for each possible combination of terms.
 * However, because docIDs are simply scanned linearly, an
 * index with a great many small documents may find this
 * linear scan too costly.
 * 
 * <p/>
 * 
 * In contrast, TermsFilter builds up an {@link OpenBitSet},
 * keyed by docID, every time it's created, by enumerating
 * through all matching docs using {@link DocsEnum} to seek
 * and scan through each term's docID list.  While there is
 * no linear scan of all docIDs, besides the allocation of
 * the underlying array in the {@link OpenBitSet}, this
 * approach requires a number of "disk seeks" in proportion
 * to the number of terms, which can be exceptionally costly
 * when there are cache misses in the OS's IO cache.
 * 
 * <p/>
 * 
 * Generally, this filter will be slower on the first
 * invocation for a given field, but subsequent invocations,
 * even if you change the allowed set of Terms, should be
 * faster than TermsFilter, especially as the number of
 * Terms being matched increases.  If you are matching only
 * a very small number of terms, and those terms in turn
 * match a very small number of documents, TermsFilter may
 * perform faster.
 *
 * <p/>
 *
 * Which filter is best is very application dependent.
