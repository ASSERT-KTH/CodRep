/** Utility class to safely share {@link IndexSearcher} instances
 *  across multiple threads, while periodically reopening.
 *  This class ensures each IndexSearcher instance is not
 *  closed until it is no longer needed.
 *
 *  <p>Use {@link #acquire} to obtain the current searcher, and
 *  {@link #release} to release it, like this:
 *
 *  <pre>
 *    IndexSearcher s = manager.acquire();
 *    try {
 *      // Do searching, doc retrieval, etc. with s
 *    } finally {
 *      manager.release(s);
 *    }
 *    // Do not use s after this!
 *    s = null;
 *  </pre>
 *
 *  <p>In addition you should periodically call {@link
 *  #maybeReopen}.  While it's possible to call this just
 *  before running each query, this is discouraged since it
 *  penalizes the unlucky queries that do the reopen.  It's
 *  better to  use a separate background thread, that
 *  periodically calls maybeReopen.  Finally, be sure to
 *  call {@link #close} once you are done.
 *
 *  <p><b>NOTE</b>: if you have an {@link IndexWriter}, it's
 *  better to use {@link NRTManager} since that class pulls
 *  near-real-time readers from the IndexWriter.
