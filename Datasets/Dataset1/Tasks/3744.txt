/**
  An <code>IndexWriter</code> creates and maintains an index.

  <p>The <code>create</code> argument to the 
  <a href="#IndexWriter(org.apache.lucene.store.Directory, org.apache.lucene.analysis.Analyzer, boolean)"><b>constructor</b></a>
  determines whether a new index is created, or whether an existing index is
  opened.  Note that you
  can open an index with <code>create=true</code> even while readers are
  using the index.  The old readers will continue to search
  the "point in time" snapshot they had opened, and won't
  see the newly created index until they re-open.  There are
  also <a href="#IndexWriter(org.apache.lucene.store.Directory, org.apache.lucene.analysis.Analyzer)"><b>constructors</b></a>
  with no <code>create</code> argument which
  will create a new index if there is not already an index at the
  provided path and otherwise open the existing index.</p>

  <p>In either case, documents are added with <a
  href="#addDocument(org.apache.lucene.document.Document)"><b>addDocument</b></a>
  and removed with <a
  href="#deleteDocuments(org.apache.lucene.index.Term)"><b>deleteDocuments</b></a>
  or <a
  href="#deleteDocuments(org.apache.lucene.search.Query)"><b>deleteDocuments</b></a>.
  A document can be updated with <a href="#updateDocument(org.apache.lucene.index.Term, org.apache.lucene.document.Document)"><b>updateDocument</b></a> 
  (which just deletes and then adds the entire document).
  When finished adding, deleting and updating documents, <a href="#close()"><b>close</b></a> should be called.</p>

  <a name="flush"></a>
  <p>These changes are buffered in memory and periodically
  flushed to the {@link Directory} (during the above method
  calls).  A flush is triggered when there are enough
  buffered deletes (see {@link #setMaxBufferedDeleteTerms})
  or enough added documents since the last flush, whichever
  is sooner.  For the added documents, flushing is triggered
  either by RAM usage of the documents (see {@link
  #setRAMBufferSizeMB}) or the number of added documents.
  The default is to flush when RAM usage hits 16 MB.  For
  best indexing speed you should flush by RAM usage with a
  large RAM buffer.  Note that flushing just moves the
  internal buffered state in IndexWriter into the index, but
  these changes are not visible to IndexReader until either
  {@link #commit} or {@link #close} is called.  A flush may
  also trigger one or more segment merges which by default
  run with a background thread so as not to block the
  addDocument calls (see <a href="#mergePolicy">below</a>
  for changing the {@link MergeScheduler}).</p>

  <a name="autoCommit"></a>
  <p>[<b>Deprecated</b>: Note that in 3.0, IndexWriter will
  no longer accept autoCommit=true (it will be hardwired to
  false).  You can always call {@link IndexWriter#commit()} yourself
  when needed].  The optional <code>autoCommit</code> argument to the <a
  href="#IndexWriter(org.apache.lucene.store.Directory,
  boolean,
  org.apache.lucene.analysis.Analyzer)"><b>constructors</b></a>
  controls visibility of the changes to {@link IndexReader}
  instances reading the same index.  When this is
  <code>false</code>, changes are not visible until {@link
  #close()} is called.  Note that changes will still be
  flushed to the {@link org.apache.lucene.store.Directory}
  as new files, but are not committed (no new
  <code>segments_N</code> file is written referencing the
  new files, nor are the files sync'd to stable storage)
  until {@link #commit} or {@link #close} is called.  If something
  goes terribly wrong (for example the JVM crashes), then
  the index will reflect none of the changes made since the
  last commit, or the starting state if commit was not called.
  You can also call {@link #abort}, which closes the writer
  without committing any changes, and removes any index
  files that had been flushed but are now unreferenced.
  This mode is useful for preventing readers from refreshing
  at a bad time (for example after you've done all your
  deletes but before you've done your adds).  It can also be
  used to implement simple single-writer transactional
  semantics ("all or none").</p>

  <p>When <code>autoCommit</code> is <code>true</code> then
  the writer will periodically commit on its own.  This is
  the default, to match the behavior before 2.2.  However,
  in 3.0, autoCommit will be hardwired to false.  There is
  no guarantee when exactly an auto commit will occur (it
  used to be after every flush, but it is now after every
  completed merge, as of 2.4).  If you want to force a
  commit, call {@link #commit}, or, close the writer.  Once
  a commit has finished, ({@link IndexReader} instances will
  see the changes to the index as of that commit.  When
  running in this mode, be careful not to refresh your
  readers while optimize or segment merges are taking place
  as this can tie up substantial disk space.</p>
  
  <p>Regardless of <code>autoCommit</code>, an {@link
  IndexReader} or {@link org.apache.lucene.search.IndexSearcher} will only see the
  index as of the "point in time" that it was opened.  Any
  changes committed to the index after the reader was opened
  are not visible until the reader is re-opened.</p>

  <p>If an index will not have more documents added for a while and optimal search
  performance is desired, then the <a href="#optimize()"><b>optimize</b></a>
  method should be called before the index is closed.</p>

  <p>Opening an <code>IndexWriter</code> creates a lock file for the directory in use. Trying to open
  another <code>IndexWriter</code> on the same directory will lead to a
  {@link LockObtainFailedException}. The {@link LockObtainFailedException}
  is also thrown if an IndexReader on the same directory is used to delete documents
  from the index.</p>
  
  <a name="deletionPolicy"></a>
  <p>Expert: <code>IndexWriter</code> allows an optional
  {@link IndexDeletionPolicy} implementation to be
  specified.  You can use this to control when prior commits
  are deleted from the index.  The default policy is {@link
  KeepOnlyLastCommitDeletionPolicy} which removes all prior
  commits as soon as a new commit is done (this matches
  behavior before 2.2).  Creating your own policy can allow
  you to explicitly keep previous "point in time" commits
  alive in the index for some time, to allow readers to
  refresh to the new commit without having the old commit
  deleted out from under them.  This is necessary on
  filesystems like NFS that do not support "delete on last
  close" semantics, which Lucene's "point in time" search
  normally relies on. </p>

  <a name="mergePolicy"></a> <p>Expert:
  <code>IndexWriter</code> allows you to separately change
  the {@link MergePolicy} and the {@link MergeScheduler}.
  The {@link MergePolicy} is invoked whenever there are
  changes to the segments in the index.  Its role is to
  select which merges to do, if any, and return a {@link
  MergePolicy.MergeSpecification} describing the merges.  It
  also selects merges to do for optimize().  (The default is
  {@link LogByteSizeMergePolicy}.  Then, the {@link
  MergeScheduler} is invoked with the requested merges and
  it decides when and how to run the merges.  The default is
  {@link ConcurrentMergeScheduler}. </p>
*/

/*
 * Clarification: Check Points (and commits)
 * Being able to set autoCommit=false allows IndexWriter to flush and 
 * write new index files to the directory without writing a new segments_N
 * file which references these new files. It also means that the state of 
 * the in memory SegmentInfos object is different than the most recent
 * segments_N file written to the directory.
 * 
 * Each time the SegmentInfos is changed, and matches the (possibly 
 * modified) directory files, we have a new "check point". 
 * If the modified/new SegmentInfos is written to disk - as a new 
 * (generation of) segments_N file - this check point is also an 
 * IndexCommit.
 * 
 * With autoCommit=true, every checkPoint is also a CommitPoint.
 * With autoCommit=false, some checkPoints may not be commits.
 * 
 * A new checkpoint always replaces the previous checkpoint and 
 * becomes the new "front" of the index. This allows the IndexFileDeleter 
 * to delete files that are referenced only by stale checkpoints.
 * (files that were created since the last commit, but are no longer
 * referenced by the "front" of the index). For this, IndexFileDeleter 
 * keeps track of the last non commit checkpoint.

   * Requests an "optimize" operation on an index, priming the index
   * for the fastest available search. Traditionally this has meant
   * merging all segments into a single segment as is done in the
   * default merge policy, but individaul merge policies may implement
   * optimize in different ways.
   *
   * @see LogMergePolicy#findMergesForOptimize
   *
   * <p>It is recommended that this method be called upon completion of indexing.  In
   * environments with frequent updates, optimize is best done during low volume times, if at all. 
   * 
   * </p>
   * <p>See http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-dev/47895 for more discussion. </p>
   *
   * <p>Note that this can require substantial temporary free
   * space in the Directory (see <a target="_top"
   * href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-764">LUCENE-764</a>
   * for details):</p>
   *
   * <ul>
   * <li>
   * 
   * <p>If no readers/searchers are open against the index,
   * then free space required is up to 1X the total size of
   * the starting index.  For example, if the starting
   * index is 10 GB, then you must have up to 10 GB of free
   * space before calling optimize.</p>
   *
   * <li>
   * 
   * <p>If readers/searchers are using the index, then free
   * space required is up to 2X the size of the starting
   * index.  This is because in addition to the 1X used by
   * optimize, the original 1X of the starting index is
   * still consuming space in the Directory as the readers
   * are holding the segments files open.  Even on Unix,
   * where it will appear as if the files are gone ("ls"
   * won't list them), they still consume storage due to
   * "delete on last close" semantics.</p>
   * 
   * <p>Furthermore, if some but not all readers re-open
   * while the optimize is underway, this will cause > 2X
   * temporary space to be consumed as those new readers
   * will then hold open the partially optimized segments at
   * that time.  It is best not to re-open readers while
   * optimize is running.</p>
   *
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>The actual temporary usage could be much less than
   * these figures (it depends on many factors).</p>
   *
   * <p>In general, once the optimize completes, the total size of the
   * index will be less than the size of the starting index.
   * It could be quite a bit smaller (if there were many
   * pending deletes) or just slightly smaller.</p>
   *
   * <p>If an Exception is hit during optimize(), for example
   * due to disk full, the index will not be corrupt and no
   * documents will have been lost.  However, it may have
   * been partially optimized (some segments were merged but
   * not all), and it's possible that one of the segments in
   * the index will be in non-compound format even when
   * using compound file format.  This will occur when the
   * Exception is hit during conversion of the segment into
   * compound format.</p>
   *
   * <p>This call will optimize those segments present in
   * the index when the call started.  If other threads are
   * still adding documents and flushing segments, those
   * newly created segments will not be optimized unless you
   * call optimize again.</p>

   * <p>This may be used to parallelize batch indexing.  A large document
   * collection can be broken into sub-collections.  Each sub-collection can be
   * indexed in parallel, on a different thread, process or machine.  The
   * complete index can then be created by merging sub-collection indexes
   * with this method.
   *
   * <p><b>NOTE:</b> the index in each Directory must not be
   * changed (opened by a writer) while this method is
   * running.  This method does not acquire a write lock in
   * each input Directory, so it is up to the caller to
   * enforce this.
   *
   * <p><b>NOTE:</b> while this is running, any attempts to
   * add or delete documents (with another thread) will be
   * paused until this method completes.
   *
   * <p>After this completes, the index is optimized.
   *
   * <p>This method is transactional in how Exceptions are
   * handled: it does not commit a new segments_N file until
   * all indexes are added.  This means if an Exception
   * occurs (for example disk full), then either no indexes
   * will have been added or they all will have been.</p>
   *
   * <p>If an Exception is hit, it's still possible that all
   * indexes were successfully added.  This happens when the
   * Exception is hit when trying to build a CFS file.  In
   * this case, one segment in the index will be in non-CFS
   * format, even when using compound file format.</p>
   *
   * <p>Also note that on an Exception, the index may still
   * have been partially or fully optimized even though none
   * of the input indexes were added. </p>
   *
   * <p>Note that this requires temporary free space in the
   * Directory up to 2X the sum of all input indexes
   * (including the starting index).  If readers/searchers
   * are open against the starting index, then temporary
   * free space required will be higher by the size of the
   * starting index (see {@link #optimize()} for details).
   * </p>
   *
   * <p>Once this completes, the final size of the index
   * will be less than the sum of all input index sizes
   * (including the starting index).  It could be quite a
   * bit smaller (if there were many pending deletes) or
   * just slightly smaller.</p>
