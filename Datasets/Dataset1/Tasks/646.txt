	/**
		Maintains a list of all the contexts that this thread has created
		and/or used. The object stored in the thread local varys according
		how this thread has been used and will be one of:

		<UL>
		<LI> null - the thread no affiliation with a context manager.

		<LI> ContextManager - the current thread has used or is using
            this context manager. If ContextManager.activeThread equals
            the current thread then the thread is currently active with
            the ContextManager. In this case ContextManager.activeCount
            will be greater than zero and represent the level of nested
            setCurrentContextmanager calls.
            If ContextManager.activeThread is null then no other thread
            is using the Contextmanager, if ContextManager.activeThread
            is not-null and not equal to the current thread then some
            other thread is using the context. It is assumed that
            only a single thread can be using a ContextManager at any time
            and this is enforced by synchronization outside the ContextManager.
            E.g for JDBC connections, synchronization at the JDBC level.

		<LI> java.util.Stack containing ContextManagers - the current
        thread is actively using multiple different ContextManagers,
        with nesting. All ContextManagers in the stack will have
        activeThread set to the current thread, and their activeCount
        set to -1. This is beacause nesting is soley represented by
        the stack, with the current context manager on top of the stack.
        This supports multiple levels of nesting across two stacks, e.g.
        C1->C2->C2->C1->C2.
		</UL>

		This thread local is used to find the current context manager. Basically it provides
		fast access to a list of candidate contexts. If one of the contexts has its activeThread
		equal to the current thread then it is the current context manager.

		If the thread has pushed multiple contexts (e.g. open a new non-nested Cloudscape connection
		from a server side method) then threadContextList will contain a Stack. The value for each cm
		will be a push order, with higher numbers being more recently pushed.

		To support the case where a single context manager is pushed twice (nested connection),
		the context manager keeps track of the number of times it has been pushed (set). Note that
		our synchronization requires that a single context can only be accessed by a single thread at a time.
		In the JDBC layer this is enforced by the synchronization on the connection object.

		<P>
		There are two cases we are trying to optimise.
		<UL>
		<LI> Typical JDBC client program where there a Connection is always executed using a single thread.
			In this case this variable will contain the Connection's context manager 
		<LI> Typical application server pooled connection where a single thread may use a connection from a pool
		for the lifetime of the request. In this case this variable will contain a  WeakReference.
		</UL>
        <BR>
        Single thread for Connection exection.

        Note nesting of orignal Contextmanager cm is changed

        once multiple ContextManagers are involved.
