/** Expert: Scoring functionality for phrase queries.
 * <br>A document is considered matching if it contains the phrase-query terms  
 * at "valid" positions. What "valid positions" are
 * depends on the type of the phrase query: for an exact phrase query terms are required 
 * to appear in adjacent locations, while for a sloppy phrase query some distance between 
 * the terms is allowed. The abstract method {@link #phraseFreq()} of extending classes
 * is invoked for each document containing all the phrase query terms, in order to 
 * compute the frequency of the phrase query in that document. A non zero frequency
 * means a match.
