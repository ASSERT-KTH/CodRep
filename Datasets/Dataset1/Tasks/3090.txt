   * Method for query time joining.

   * Execute the returned query with a {@link IndexSearcher} to retrieve all documents that have the same terms in the
   * to field that match with documents matching the specified fromQuery and have the same terms in the from field.
   * <p/>
   * In the case a single document relates to more than one document the <code>multipleValuesPerDocument</code> option
   * should be set to true. When the <code>multipleValuesPerDocument</code> is set to <code>true</code> only the
   * the score from the first encountered join value originating from the 'from' side is mapped into the 'to' side.
   * Even in the case when a second join value related to a specific document yields a higher score. Obviously this
   * doesn't apply in the case that {@link ScoreMode#None} is used, since no scores are computed at all.
   * </p>
   * Memory considerations: During joining all unique join values are kept in memory. On top of that when the scoreMode
   * isn't set to {@link ScoreMode#None} a float value per unique join value is kept in memory for computing scores.
   * When scoreMode is set to {@link ScoreMode#Avg} also an additional integer value is kept in memory per unique
   * join value.
   *
   * @param fromField                 The from field to join from
   * @param multipleValuesPerDocument Whether the from field has multiple terms per document
   * @param toField                   The to field to join to
   * @param fromQuery                 The query to match documents on the from side
   * @param fromSearcher              The searcher that executed the specified fromQuery
   * @param scoreMode                 Instructs how scores from the fromQuery are mapped to the returned query
   * @return a {@link Query} instance that can be used to join documents based on the
