/**
 * Run the full upgrade suite. This is the only
 * way to run tests in this package.
 * A set of tests are run against a number of
 * previous releases, see the static OLD_VERSIONS
 * field in this class.
 * 
 * Each test against the old release consists of following phases:
   
    <OL>
    <LI> Create database with the <B>old</B> release.
    <LI> Boot the database with the <B>new</B> release in soft upgrade mode.
    Try to execute functionality that is not allowed in soft upgrade.
    <LI> Boot the database with the <B>old</B> release to ensure the
    database can be booted by the old release after soft upgrade.
    <LI> Boot the database with the <B>new</B> release in hard upgrade mode,
    specifying the upgrade=true attribute.
    <LI> Boot the database with the <B>old</B> release to ensure the
    database can not be booted by the old release after hard upgrade.
    </OL>
    The class PhaseChanger is the decorator that sets up the
    fixtures to run in a given phase.

    <P>
    The test fixtures themseleves are in JUnit test classes
    that are sub-classes of UpgradeChange. The set of fixtures
    in BasicSetup is general setup and the changes per release
    are in classes of the form Changes10_1 etc.
    
    <P>
    The class UpgradeRun hooks up the test fixtures for a set
    of runs against a single old release into a single suite.
    Each fixture is run multiple times, once per phase against
    each old release.
