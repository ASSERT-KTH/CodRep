/**
 * <p>Expert: a MergePolicy determines the sequence of
 * primitive merge operations to be used for overall merge
 * and optimize operations.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Whenever the segments in an index have been altered by
 * {@link IndexWriter}, either the addition of a newly
 * flushed segment, addition of many segments from
 * addIndexes* calls, or a previous merge that may now need
 * to cascade, {@link IndexWriter} invokes {@link
 * #findMerges} to give the MergePolicy a chance to pick
 * merges that are now required.  This method returns a
 * {@link MergeSpecification} instance describing the set of
 * merges that should be done, or null if no merges are
 * necessary.  When IndexWriter.optimize is called, it calls
 * {@link #findMergesForOptimize} and the MergePolicy should
 * then return the necessary merges.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that the policy can return more than one merge at
 * a time.  In this case, if the writer is using {@link
 * SerialMergeScheduler}, the merges will be run
 * sequentially but if it is using {@link
 * ConcurrentMergeScheduler} they will be run concurrently.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The default MergePolicy is {@link
 * LogByteSizeMergePolicy}.</p>
