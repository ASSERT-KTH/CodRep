/**
 * Behaviors are kind of plug-ins for Components. They allow functionality to be added to a
 * component and get essential events forwarded by the component. They can be bound to a concrete
 * component (using the bind method which is called when the behavior is attached), but they don't
 * need to. They can modify the components markup by changing the rendered ComponentTag. Behaviors
 * can have their own models as well, and they are notified when these are to be detached by the
 * component.
 * <p>
 * It is recommended that you extend from {@link org.apache.wicket.behavior.AbstractBehavior}
 * instead of directly implementing this interface.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note that behavors are only called during render. They are not the same as events like link
 * listeners etc.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You also cannot modify a components model with a behavor.
