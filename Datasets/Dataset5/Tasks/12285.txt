/**
 * A cache to create and maintain {@link FinderQuery finder queries}. 
 * 
 * A finder query is a query to find instance of a given class by its primary
 * identity. This cache maintains finder queries by generic identifier of
 * parameterized type K.
 * 
 * A cached query by an identifier of parameterized type K. 
 * 
 * A query can be cached by an identifier and value represented by parameterized 
 * type V. Caching results in creating a new instance of FinderQuery FQ from the 
 * value V such that FQ can be executed to return a result of parameterized type 
 * R. A request to cache may not be successful if this cache determines the 
 * value V to be not cachable.
 * 
 * Both get() and put() operations can be controlled by the hints associated 
 * with FetchConfiguration.
 *  
 * The target database query FQ associated to a cached finder query F  
 * <em>may</em> depend upon query execution context such as fetch plan or 
 * lock group. This cache, by design, does not monitor the context or 
 * automatically invalidate an entry when the original query F is executed  
 * with context parameters that affect the target query FQ. 
 * 
 * The user must notify this receiver to invalidate a cached entry when 
 * execution context changes in a way that will modify the resultant database 
 * language query FQ.
 * 
 * One of the built-in mechanism (available in JPA facade) is to set query hints 
 * to either invalidate the query entirely or ignore the cached version for the 
 * current execution. 
 * 
 * @see QueryHints#HINT_IGNORE_FINDER
 * @see QueryHints#HINT_INVALIDATE_FINDER
 * @see QueryHints#HINT_RECACHE_FINDER
 * 
 * This cache allows customization of whether a query can be cached or not
 * via either explicit marking of certain classes as non-cachable (which is 
 * irreversible) or addition/removal of exclusion patterns (which is reversible)
