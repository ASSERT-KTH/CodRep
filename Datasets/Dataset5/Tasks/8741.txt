 * Behaviors are kind of plug-ins for Components. They allow to be added to a
 * component and get essential events forwarded by the component. they can be
 * bound to a concrete component (using the bind method is called when the
 * behavior is attached), but they don't need to. They can modify the components
 * markup by changing the rendered ComponentTag. Behaviors can have their own
 * models as well, and they are notified when these are to be detached by the
 * component.

 * It is recommended that you extend from
