 * Listens for requests regarding resources. Such resources are typically non-static in nature and
 * may even be created on the fly.
 * <p>
 * One use for resource listeners is that they may be used to create components such as Image which
 * respond to requests with a localized resource loaded from the classpath. The Image class allows
 * reusable components to transparently bundle localized image resources. Components that use Image
 * resources (instead of referencing static images in their markup) can be distributed as a
 * self-contained JAR file.
