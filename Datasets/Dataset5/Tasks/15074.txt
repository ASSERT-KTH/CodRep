/**
 * Moves a file or directory to a new file or directory.  By default,
 * the destination is overwriten when existing.  When overwrite is
 * turned off, then files are only moved if the source file is 
 * newer than the destination file, or when the destination file does
 * not exist.</p>
 *
 * <p>Source files and directories are only deleted when the file or 
 * directory has been copied to the destination successfully.  Filtering
 * also works.</p>
 *
 * <p>This implementation is based on Arnout Kuiper's initial design
 * document, the following mailing list discussions, and the 
 * copyfile/copydir tasks.</p>
