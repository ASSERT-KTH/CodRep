/**
 * This class provides a mock implementation of a Wicket HTTP based
 * application that can be used for testing. It emulates all of the
 * functionality of an HttpServlet in a controlled, single-threaded
 * environment. It is supported with mock objects for HttpSession,
 * HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse and ServletContext.
 * <p>
 * In its most basic usage you can just create a new MockHttpApplication.
 * This should be sufficient to allow you to construct components and
 * pages and so on for testing. To use certain features such as localization
 * you must also call setupRequestAndResponse().
 * <p>
 * The application takes an optional path attribute that defines a directory
 * on the disk which will correspond to the root of the WAR bundle. This
 * can then be used for locating non-application resources.
 * <p>
 * To actually test the processing of a particular page or component
 * you can also call processRequestCycle() to do all the normal work
 * of a Wicket request.
 * <p>
 * Between calling setupRequestAndResponse() and processRequestCycle()
 * you can get hold of any of the objects for initialisation. The
 * servlet request object has some handy convenience methods for
 * initialising the request to invoke certain types of pages and
 * components.
 * <p>
 * After completion of processRequestCycle() you will probably just be
 * testing component states. However, you also have full access to
 * the wicket.response document (or binary data) and result codes via the
 * servlet wicket.response object.
 * <p>
 * IMPORTANT NOTES
 * <ul>
 * <li>This harness is SINGLE THREADED - there is only one global
 * session. For multi-threaded testing you must do integration testing
 * with a full application server.
 * </ul>
