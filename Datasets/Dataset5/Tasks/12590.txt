/**
 * Interface for request related settings
 * <p>
 * <i>bufferResponse </i> (defaults to true) - True if the application should buffer responses. This
 * does require some additional memory, but helps keep exception displays accurate because the whole
 * rendering process completes before the page is sent to the user, thus avoiding the possibility of
 * a partially rendered page.
 * <p>
 * <i>renderStrategy </i>- Sets in what way the render part of a request is handled. Basically,
 * there are two different options:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Direct, ApplicationSettings.ONE_PASS_RENDER. Everything is handled in one physical request.
 * This is efficient, and is the best option if you want to do sophisticated clustering. It does not
 * however, shield you from what is commonly known as the <i>Double submit problem </i></li>
 * <li>Using a redirect. This follows the pattern <a
 * href="http://www.theserverside.com/articles/article.tss?l=RedirectAfterPost" >as described at the
 * serverside </a> and that is commonly known as Redirect after post. Wicket takes it one step
 * further to do any rendering after a redirect, so that not only form submits are shielded from the
 * double submit problem, but also the IRequestListener handlers (that could be e.g. a link that
 * deletes a row). With this pattern, you have two options to choose from:
 * <ul>
 * <li>ApplicationSettings.REDIRECT_TO_RENDER. This option first handles the 'action' part of the
 * request, which is either page construction (bookmarkable pages or the home page) or calling a
 * IRequestListener handler, such as Link.onClick. When that part is done, a redirect is issued to
 * the render part, which does all the rendering of the page and its components. <strong>Be aware
 * </strong> that this may mean, depending on whether you access any models in the action part of
 * the request, that attachment and detachment of some models is done twice for a request.</li>
 * <li>ApplicationSettings.REDIRECT_TO_BUFFER. This option handles both the action- and the render
 * part of the request in one physical request, but instead of streaming the result to the browser
 * directly, it is kept in memory, and a redirect is issue to get this buffered result (after which
 * it is immediately removed). This option currently is the default render strategy, as it shields
 * you from the double submit problem, while being more efficient and less error prone regarding to
 * detachable models.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * Note that this parameter sets the default behavior, but that you can manually set whether any
 * redirecting is done by calling method RequestCycle.setRedirect. Setting the redirect flag when
 * the application is configured to use ONE_PASS_RENDER, will result in a redirect of type
 * REDIRECT_TO_RENDER. When the application is configured to use REDIRECT_TO_RENDER or
 * REDIRECT_TO_BUFFER, setting the redirect flag to false, will result in that request begin
 * rendered and streamed in one pass.
 * <p>
 * More documentation is available about each setting in the setter method for the property.

		 * the behavior will be like RenderStragegy 'REDIRECT_TO_RENDER'.
		 * <p>
		 * This strategy is more efficient than the 'REDIRECT_TO_RENDER' strategy, and doesn't have

		/**
		 * The render part of a request (opposed to the 'action part' which is either the
		 * construction of a bookmarkable page or the execution of a IRequestListener handler) is
		 * handled by a separate request by issuing a redirect request to the browser. This is
		 * commonly known as the 'redirect after submit' pattern, though in our case, we use it for
		 * GET and POST requests instead of just the POST requests. To cancel the client side
		 * redirect for a request, users can set the 'redirect' property of {@link RequestCycle}to
		 * false (getRequestCycle.setRedirect(false)).
		 * <p>
		 * This pattern solves the 'refresh' problem. While it is a common feature of browsers to
		 * refresh/ reload a web page, this results in problems in many dynamic web applications.
		 * For example, when you have a link with an event handler that e.g. deletes a row from a
		 * list, you usually want to ignore refresh requests after that link is clicked on. By using
		 * this strategy, the refresh request only results in the re-rendering of the page without
		 * executing the event handler again.
		 * </p>
		 * <p>
		 * Though it solves the refresh problem, it introduces potential problems, as the request
		 * that is logically one, are actually two separate request. Not only is this less
		 * efficient, but this also can mean that within the same request attachment/ detachment of
		 * models is done twice (in case you use models in the bookmarkable page constructors and
		 * IRequestListener handlers). If you use this strategy, you should be aware of this
		 * possibility, and should also be aware that for one logical request, actually two
		 * instances of RequestCycle are created and processed.
		 * </p>
		 * <p>
		 * Also, even with this strategy set, it is ignored for
		 * {@link BookmarkableListenerInterfaceRequestTarget}s, because otherwise they wouldn't be
		 * bookmarkable.
