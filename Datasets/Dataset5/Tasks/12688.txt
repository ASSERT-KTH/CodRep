/**
 * A prepared query associates a compiled query to a <em>parsed state</em> that
 * can be executed possibly with more efficiency. An obvious example is to 
 * associate a compiled query to an executable SQL string. 
 * 
 * The query expressed in target language can be executed directly bypassing 
 * the critical translation cost to the data store target language on every 
 * execution. 
 * 
 * As the subsequent execution of a cached query will bypass normal query 
 * compilation, the post-compilation state of the original query is captured by 
 * this receiver to be transferred to the executable query instance.  
 * 
 * This receiver must not hold any context-sensitive reference or dependency.
 * Because the whole idea of preparing a query (for a cost) is to be able to
 * execute the same logical query in different persistence contexts. However,
 * a prepared query may not be valid when some parameters of execution context  
 * such as lock group or fetch plan changes in a way that will change the target
 * query. Refer to {@link PreparedQueryCache} for invalidation mechanism on
 * possible actions under such circumstances.
 * 
 * The query execution model <em>does</em> account for context changes that do 
 * not impact the target query e.g. bind variables.
