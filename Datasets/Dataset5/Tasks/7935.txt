/**
 * Listens for requests regarding resources. Such resources are typically
 * non-static in nature and may even be created on the fly.
 * <p>
 * One use for resource listeners is that they may be used to create components
 * such as Image which respond to requests with a localized resource loaded from
 * the classpath. The Image class allows reusable components to transparently
 * bundle localized image resources. Components that use Image resources
 * (instead of referencing static images in their markup) can be distributed as
 * a self-contained JAR file.
