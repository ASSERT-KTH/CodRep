/** 
 * A class to help send SMTP email.
 * This class is an improvement on the sun.net.smtp.SmtpClient class 
 * found in the JDK.  This version has extra functionality, and can be used
 * with JVMs that did not extend from the JDK.  It's not as robust as
 * the JavaMail Standard Extension classes, but it's easier to use and 
 * easier to install, and has an Open Source license.
 * <p>
 * It can be used like this:
 * <blockquote><pre>
 * String mailhost = "localhost";  // or another mail host
 * String from = "Mail Message Servlet &lt;MailMessage@server.com&gt;";
 * String to = "to@you.com";
 * String cc1 = "cc1@you.com";
 * String cc2 = "cc2@you.com";
 * String bcc = "bcc@you.com";
 * &nbsp;
 * MailMessage msg = new MailMessage(mailhost);
 * msg.setPort(25);
 * msg.from(from);
 * msg.to(to);
 * msg.cc(cc1);
 * msg.cc(cc2);
 * msg.bcc(bcc);
 * msg.setSubject("Test subject");
 * PrintStream out = msg.getPrintStream();
 * &nbsp;
 * Enumeration enum = req.getParameterNames();
 * while (enum.hasMoreElements()) {
 *   String name = (String)enum.nextElement();
 *   String value = req.getParameter(name);
 *   out.println(name + " = " + value);
 * }
 * &nbsp;
 * msg.sendAndClose();
 * </pre></blockquote>
 * <p>
 * Be sure to set the from address, then set the recepient 
 * addresses, then set the subject and other headers, then get the 
 * PrintStream, then write the message, and finally send and close.
 * The class does minimal error checking internally; it counts on the mail
 * host to complain if there's any malformatted input or out of order 
 * execution.  
 * <p>
 * An attachment mechanism based on RFC 1521 could be implemented on top of
 * this class.  In the meanwhile, JavaMail is the best solution for sending
 * email with attachments.
 * <p>
 * Still to do:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Figure out how to close the connection in case of error
 * </ul>
 *
 * @author Jason Hunter
 * @version 1.1, 2000/03/19, added angle brackets to address, helps some servers
 * version 1.0, 1999/12/29
