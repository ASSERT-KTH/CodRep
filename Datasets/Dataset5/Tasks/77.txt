/**
 * Bread crumbs provide a means to track certain history of client actions.
 * Bread crumbs are typically rendered as a list of links, and are useful when
 * users 'dig deeper' into the site structure so that they can find their way
 * back again and have a notion of where they currently are.
 * <p>
 * Bread crumbs in the original sense just represent where people are in a site
 * hierarchy. For example, when browsing a product site, bread crumbs could look
 * like this:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *          Home &gt; Products &amp; Solutions &gt; Hardware &gt; Desktop Systems
 * </pre>
 * 
 * or
 * 
 * <pre>
 *          World &gt; Europe &gt; The Netherlands &gt; Utrecht
 * </pre>
 * 
 * These items would be rendered as links to the corresponding site location.
 * </p>
 * Classes that implement this interface are responsible for managing such a
 * bread crumb structure. A {@link BreadCrumbBar typical implementation} regards
 * bread crumbs as a stack. When
 * {@link #setActive(IBreadCrumbParticipant) a bread crumb is activated} that
 * was not in the stack yet, it would add it to the stack, or when a bread crumb
 * is activated that is already on the stack, it would roll back to the
 * corresponding depth.
 * <p>
 * This model does not make any presumptions on how it should interact with
 * components. Just that there is a list of
 * {@link IBreadCrumbParticipant bread crumb participants}, and the notion of a
 * currently active bread crumb participant.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A {@link IBreadCrumbParticipant bread crumb participant} is not an actual
 * bread crump, but rather a proxy to components that represent a certain
 * location relative to other bread crumbs in this model, and a means to get the
 * bread crumb title, which is typically rendered as a link label of the actual
 * bread crumb. The actual bread crumbs are supposed to be rendered by a
 * component that works together with this model. I choose this model as this
 * would suit what I think is one of the nicest patterns:
 * {@link BreadCrumbPanel bread crumb aware panels}.
