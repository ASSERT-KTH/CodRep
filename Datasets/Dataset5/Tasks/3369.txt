/**
 * A PropertyModel is used to dynamically access a model using a "property
 * expression". See {@link PropertyResolver} javadoc for allowed property
 * expressions.
 * <p>
 * For example, take the following bean:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * public class Person
 * {
 * 	private String name;
 * 
 * 	public String getName()
 * 	{
 * 		return name;
 * 	}
 * 
 * 	public void setName(String name)
 * 	{
 * 		this.name = name;
 * 	}
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * We could construct a label that dynamically fetches the name property of the
 * given person object like this:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *     Person person = getSomePerson();
 *     ...
 *     add(new Label(&quot;myLabel&quot;, new PopertyModel(person, &quot;name&quot;));
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Where 'myLabel' is the name of the component, and 'name' is the property
 * expression to get the name property.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In the same fashion, we can create form components that work dynamically on
 * the given model object. For instance, we could create a text field that
 * updates the name property of a person like this:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *     add(new TextField(&quot;myTextField&quot;, new PropertyModel(person, &quot;name&quot;));
 * </pre>
 * 
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To force conversion of property value to a specific type, you can provide
 * constructor argument 'propertyType'. if that is set, that type is used for
 * conversion instead of the type that is figured out by
 * {@link PropertyResolver}. This can be especially useful for when you have a
 * generic property (like Serializable myProp) that you want to be converted to
 * a narrower type (e.g. an Integer). {@link PropertyResolver} sees an incomming
 * string being compatible with the target property, and will then bypass the
 * converter. Hence, to force myProp being converted to and from an integer,
 * propertyType should be set to Integer.
