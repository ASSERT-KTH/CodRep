		// Integer object. If we provide the class constructor argument like we do here, we
		// get two things:
		// 1. A type validator is added, so that before any actual updating is tried, first the
		// 		user input is checked for validity. When the user input is wrong for an integer,
		//		the model updating is cancelled, and an error message is displayed to the user
		// 2.When updating the model, the given type is explicitly used instead of Ognl trying
		//		to figure out what type should be converted to.
		// Note that the default validation message mechanism uses resource bundles for the actual
		// message lookup. The message for this component can be found in TextFieldPage.properties
		// with key 'form.integer.TypeValidator'. Read more about how this works in the javadocs
		// of AbstractValidator
