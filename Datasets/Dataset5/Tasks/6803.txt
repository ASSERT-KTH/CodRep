/**
 * This selector selects files against a mapped set of target files, selecting all those
 * files which are different. A byte-by-byte comparision is performed on equal length files;
 * files with different lengths are deemed different automatically; files with identical timestamps
 * are viewed as matching by default, unless you specify otherwise.
 * <p>
 * This is a useful selector to work with programs and tasks that don't handle
 * dependency checking properly; Even if a predecessor task always creates its
 * output files, followup tasks can be driven off copies made with a different selector,
 * so their dependencies are driven on the absolute state of the files, not a timestamp.
 * <p>
 * Clearly, however, bulk file comparisons is inefficient; anything that can use
 * timestamps is to be preferred. If this selector must be used, use it over as few files
 * as possible, perhaps following it with an &lt;uptodate;&gt to keep the descendent
 * routines conditional.
