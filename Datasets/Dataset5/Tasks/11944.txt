/**
 * A FileSystemManager is manages a set of file systems.  This interface is
 * used to locate a {@link FileObject} by name from one of those file systems.
 *
 * <p>To locate a {@link FileObject}, use one of the <code>resolveFile()</code>
 * methods.</p>
 *
 * <h4><a name="naming">File Naming</a></h4>
 *
 * <p>A file system manager can recognise several types of file names:
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 * <li><p>Absolute URI.  These must start with a scheme, such as
 * <code>file:</code> or <code>ftp:</code>, followed by a scheme dependent
 * file name.  Some examples:</p>
 * <pre>
 * file:/c:/somefile
 * ftp://somewhere.org/somefile
 * </pre>
 *
 * <li><p>Absolute local file name.  For example,
 * <code>/home/someuser/a-file</code> or <code>c:\dir\somefile.html</code>.
 * Elements in the name can be separated using any of the following
 * characters: <code>/</code>, <code>\</code>, or the native file separator
 * character. For example, the following file names are the same:</p>
 * <pre>
 * c:\somedir\somefile.xml
 * c:/somedir/somefile.xml
 * </pre>
 *
 * <li><p>Relative path.  For example: <code>../somefile</code> or
 * <code>somedir/file.txt</code>.   The file system manager resolves relative
 * paths against its <i>base file</i>.  Elements in the relative path can be
 * separated using <code>/</code>, <code>\</code>, or file system specific
 * separator characters.  Relative paths may also contain <code>..</code> and
 * <code>.</code> elements.  See {@link FileObject#resolveFile} for more details.</p>
 *
 * </ul>
