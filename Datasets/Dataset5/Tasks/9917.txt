/**
 * Initializes something when application loads.
 * 
 * Initializer is there for clustering. Lets say you access a page that has a link to a resource on
 * node A now the url for the resource gets forwarded to node B, but node B doesn't have the
 * resource registered yet because maybe the page class hasn't been loaded and so its static block
 * hasn't run yet. So the initializer is a place for you to register all those resources and do all
 * the stuff you used to do in the static blocks.
 * <p>
 * You don't have to pre-register {@link PackageResource package resources}, as they can be
 * initialized lazily.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Initializers can be configured by having a wicket.properties file in the class path root, with
 * property 'initializer=${initializer class name}'. You can have one such properties per jar file,
 * but the initializer that property denotes can delegate to other initializers of that library.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If an initializer also implements {@link IDestroyer}, the instance will be kept for destroying,
 * so that it may clean up whatever it did when initializing.
 * </p>
