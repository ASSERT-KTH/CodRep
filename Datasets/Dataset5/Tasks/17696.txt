/**
 * This string resource loader attempts to find the resource from a
 * bundle that corresponds the the supplied component object or one of its
 * parent containers. Generally the component will be an instance
 * of <code>Page</code>, but it may also be an instance of any reusable
 * component that is packaged along with its own resource files.
 * If the component is not an instance of <code>Page</code> then it
 * must be a component that has already been added to a page.
 * <p>
 * The search order for resources is built around the containers that
 * hold the component (if it is not a page). Consider a Page that contains
 * a Panel that contains a Label. If we pass the Label as the component
 * then resource loading will first look for the resource against the
 * page, then against the panel and finally against the label.
 * <p>
 * The above search order may seem slightly odd at first, but can be
 * explained thus: Team A writes a new component X and packages it as
 * a reusable Wicket component along with all required resources. Team B
 * then creates a new container component Y that holds a instance of an X.
 * However, Team B wishes the text to be different to that which was
 * provided with X so rather than needing to change X, they include
 * override values in the resources for Y. Finally, Team C makes use
 * of component Y in a page they are writing. Initially they are happy
 * with the text for Y so they do not include any override values in
 * the resources for the page. However, after demonstrating to the
 * customer, the customer requests the text for Y to be different.
 * Team C need only provide override values against their
 * page and thus do not need to change Y.
 * <p>
 * This implemnentation is fully aware of both locale and style
 * values when trying to obtain the appropriate resources.
