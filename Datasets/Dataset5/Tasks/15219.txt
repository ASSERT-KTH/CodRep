/**
 * This string resource loader attempts to find the resource from a bundle that
 * corresponds the the supplied component object or one of its parent
 * containers. Generally the component will be an instance of <code>Page</code>,
 * but it may also be an instance of any reusable component that is packaged
 * along with its own resource files. If the component is not an instance of
 * <code>Page</code> then it must be a component that has already been added
 * to a page.
 * <p>
 * The search order for resources is built around the containers that hold the
 * component (if it is not a page). Consider a Page that contains a Panel that
 * contains a Label. If we pass the Label as the component then resource loading
 * will first look for the resource against the page, then against the panel and
 * finally against the label.
 * <p>
 * The above search order may seem slightly odd at first, but can be explained
 * thus: Team A writes a new component X and packages it as a reusable Wicket
 * component along with all required resources. Team B then creates a new
 * container component Y that holds a instance of an X. However, Team B wishes
 * the text to be different to that which was provided with X so rather than
 * needing to change X, they include override values in the resources for Y.
 * Finally, Team C makes use of component Y in a page they are writing.
 * Initially they are happy with the text for Y so they do not include any
 * override values in the resources for the page. However, after demonstrating
 * to the customer, the customer requests the text for Y to be different. Team C
 * need only provide override values against their page and thus do not need to
 * change Y.
 * <p>
 * This implementation is fully aware of both locale and style values when
 * trying to obtain the appropriate resources.
 * <p>
 * In addition to the above search order, each component that is being searched
 * for a resource also includes the resources from any parent classes that it
 * inherits from. For example, PageA extends CommonBasePage which in turn extends
 * WebPage. When a resource lookup is requested on PageA, the resource bundle for
 * PageA is first checked. If the resource is not found in this bundle then the
 * resource bundle for CommonBasePage is checked. This allows designers of base
 * pages and components to define default sets of string resources and then
 * developers implementing subclasses to either override or extend these in their
 * own resource bundle.
