/**
 * Runs a block of code periodically. The Task can be started at a given time in
 * the future and can be a daemon. The block of code will be passed a Log object
 * each time it is run through its ICode interface.
 * <p>
 * If the code block takes longer than the period to run, the next task
 * invocation will occur immediately. In this case, tasks will not occur at
 * precise multiples of the period. For example, if you run a task every 30
 * seconds, and the first run takes 40 seconds but the second takes 20 seconds,
 * your task will be invoked at 0 seconds, 40 seconds and 70 seconds (40 seconds +
 * 30 seconds), which is not an even multiple of 30 seconds.
 * <p>
 * In general, this is a simple task class designed for polling activities. If
 * you need precise guarantees, you probably should be using a different task
 * class.
