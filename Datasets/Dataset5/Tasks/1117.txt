 * This class is the abstract superclass of all graphics resource objects.  
 * Resources created by the application must be disposed.
 * <p>
 * IMPORTANT: This class is intended to be subclassed <em>only</em>
 * within the SWT implementation. However, it has not been marked
 * final to allow those outside of the SWT development team to implement
 * patched versions of the class in order to get around specific
 * limitations in advance of when those limitations can be addressed
 * by the team.  Any class built using subclassing to access the internals
 * of this class will likely fail to compile or run between releases and
 * may be strongly platform specific. Subclassing should not be attempted
 * without an intimate and detailed understanding of the workings of the
 * hierarchy. No support is provided for user-written classes which are
 * implemented as subclasses of this class.
