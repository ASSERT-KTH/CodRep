// TODO WICKET-NG: this iface used to extend IDetachable, however this causes problems because Page becomes IDetachable and some property models will cause an infinite loop trigging detach on the component again because it is their target object. In the future Component should indeed implement IDetachable, for now copied #detach into this iface directly.
