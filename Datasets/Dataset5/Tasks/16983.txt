/**
 * ResourceReference is essentially a reference to an actual resource which is
 * shared through the Application. A ResourceReference has a name and a scope
 * (within which the name must be unique). It may also have a locale or style.
 * The locale and/or style do not need to be set on a resource reference because
 * those values will automatically be determined based on the context in which
 * the resource is being used. For example, if a ResourceReference is attached
 * to an Image component, when the locale for the page switches, the Image
 * component will notice this and automatically change the locale for the
 * referenced resource as appropriate. It's for this reason that there are no
 * constructor overloads taking a Locale or style (these details are essentially
 * internal and so the framework uses setLocale/setStyle internally so you don't
 * have to worry about it).
 * <p>
 * Resources may be added to the Application when the Application is constructed
 * using
 * {@link Application#getSharedResources()} followed by 
 * {@link SharedResources#add(Class, String, Locale, String, Resource)},
 * {@link SharedResources#add(String, Locale, Resource)}or
 * {@link SharedResources#add(String, Resource)}.
 * <p>
 * If a component has its own shared resource which should not be added to the
 * application construction logic in this way, it can lazy-initialize the
 * resource by overriding the {@link ResourceReference#newResource()}method. In
 * this method, the component should supply logic that creates the shared
 * resource.
