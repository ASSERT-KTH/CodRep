/**
 * This class is used to create a tree structure of objects.  Each element in
 * the tree is also a key to the next node down in the tree.  It provides many
 * ways to add objects and branches, as well as many ways to retrieve.
 * <p>
 * HashTree implements the Map interface for convenience reasons.  The main
 * difference between a Map and a HashTree is that the HashTree organizes the
 * data into a recursive tree structure, and provides the means to manipulate
 * that structure.
 * <p>
 * Of special interest is the {@link #traverse(HashTreeTraverser)} method,
 * which provides an expedient way to traverse any HashTree by implementing the
 * {@link HashTreeTraverser} interface in order to perform some operation on
 * the tree, or to extract information from the tree.
