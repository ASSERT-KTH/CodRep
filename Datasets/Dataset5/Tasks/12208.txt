 * This base class also creates a border for each page subclass, automatically adding
 * children of the page to the border.  This accomplishes two important things:
 * (1) subclasses do not have to repeat the code to create the border navigation and
 * (2) since subclasses do not repeat this code, they are not hardwired to page
 * navigation structure details
