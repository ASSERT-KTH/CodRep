/**
 * DOM Level 3 WD Experimental:
 * The DOM Level 3 specification is at the stage 
 * of Working Draft, which represents work in 
 * progress and thus may be updated, replaced, 
 * or obsoleted by other documents at any time. 
 * <p>
 *  <code>DOMWriter</code> provides an API for serializing (writing) a DOM 
 * document out in an XML document. The XML data is written to an output 
 * stream, the type of which depends on the specific language bindings in 
 * use. 
 * <p> During serialization of XML data, namespace fixup is done when 
 * possible.  allows empty strings as a real namespace URI. If the 
 * <code>namespaceURI</code> of a <code>Node</code> is empty string, the 
 * serialization will treat them as <code>null</code>, ignoring the prefix 
 * if any. 
 * <p> <code>DOMWriter</code> accepts any node type for serialization. For 
 * nodes of type <code>Document</code> or <code>Entity</code>, well formed 
 * XML will be created if possible. The serialized output for these node 
 * types is either as a Document or an External Entity, respectively, and is 
 * acceptable input for an XML parser. For all other types of nodes the 
 * serialized form is not specified, but should be something useful to a 
 * human for debugging or diagnostic purposes. Note: rigorously designing an 
 * external (source) form for stand-alone node types that don't already have 
 * one defined in  seems a bit much to take on here. 
 * <p>Within a Document, DocumentFragment, or Entity being serialized, Nodes 
 * are processed as follows Documents are written including an XML 
 * declaration and a DTD subset, if one exists in the DOM. Writing a 
 * document node serializes the entire document. Entity nodes, when written 
 * directly by <code>writeNode</code> defined in the <code>DOMWriter</code> 
 * interface, output the entity expansion but no namespace fixup is done. 
 * The resulting output will be valid as an external entity.  Entity 
 * reference nodes are serialized as an entity reference of the form "
 * <code>&amp;entityName;</code>" in the output. Child nodes (the expansion) 
 * of the entity reference are ignored.  CDATA sections containing content 
 * characters that can not be represented in the specified output encoding 
 * are handled according to the "split-cdata-sections" feature.If the 
 * feature is <code>true</code>, CDATA sections are split, and the 
 * unrepresentable characters are serialized as numeric character references 
 * in ordinary content. The exact position and number of splits is not 
 * specified. If the feature is <code>false</code>, unrepresentable 
 * characters in a CDATA section are reported as errors. The error is not 
 * recoverable - there is no mechanism for supplying alternative characters 
 * and continuing with the serialization. DocumentFragment nodes are 
 * serialized by serializing the children of the document fragment in the 
 * order they appear in the document fragment.  All other node types 
 * (Element, Text, etc.) are serialized to their corresponding XML source 
 * form.  The serialization of a DOM Node does not always generate a 
 * well-formed XML document, i.e. a <code>DOMBuilder</code> might through 
 * fatal errors when parsing the resulting serialization. 
 * <p> Within the character data of a document (outside of markup), any 
 * characters that cannot be represented directly are replaced with 
 * character references. Occurrences of '&lt;' and '&amp;' are replaced by 
 * the predefined entities &amp;lt; and &amp;amp. The other predefined 
 * entities (&amp;gt, &amp;apos, etc.) are not used; these characters can be 
 * included directly. Any character that can not be represented directly in 
 * the output character encoding is serialized as a numeric character 
 * reference. 
 * <p> Attributes not containing quotes are serialized in quotes. Attributes 
 * containing quotes but no apostrophes are serialized in apostrophes 
 * (single quotes). Attributes containing both forms of quotes are 
 * serialized in quotes, with quotes within the value represented by the 
 * predefined entity &amp;quot;. Any character that can not be represented 
 * directly in the output character encoding is serialized as a numeric 
 * character reference. 
 * <p> Within markup, but outside of attributes, any occurrence of a character 
 * that cannot be represented in the output character encoding is reported 
 * as an error. An example would be serializing the element 
 * &lt;LaCa√±ada/&gt; with the encoding="us-ascii". 
 * <p> When requested by setting the <code>normalize-characters</code> feature 
 * on <code>DOMWriter</code>, all data to be serialized, both markup and 
 * character data, is W3C Text normalized according to the rules defined in 
 * . The W3C Text normalization process affects only the data as it is being 
 * written; it does not alter the DOM's view of the document after 
 * serialization has completed. 
 * <p>Namespaces are fixed up during serialization, the serialization process 
 * will verify that namespace declarations, namespace prefixes and the 
 * namespace URIs associated with Elements and Attributes are consistent. If 
 * inconsistencies are found, the serialized form of the document will be 
 * altered to remove them. The algorithm used for doing the namespace fixup 
 * while serializing a document is a combination of the algorithms used for 
 * lookupNamespaceURI and lookupNamespacePrefix . previous paragraph to be 
 * defined closer here.
 * <p>Any changes made affect only the namespace prefixes and declarations 
 * appearing in the serialized data. The DOM's view of the document is not 
 * altered by the serialization operation, and does not reflect any changes 
 * made to namespace declarations or prefixes in the serialized output. 
 * <p> While serializing a document the serializer will write out 
 * non-specified values (such as attributes whose <code>specified</code> is 
 * <code>false</code>) if the <code>discard-default-content</code> feature 
 * is set to <code>true</code>. If the <code>discard-default-content</code> 
 * flag is set to <code>false</code> and a schema is used for validation, 
 * the schema will be also used to determine if a value is specified or not. 
 * If no schema is used, the <code>specified</code> flag on attribute nodes 
 * is used to determine if attribute values should be written out. 
 * <p> Ref to Core spec (1.1.9, XML namespaces, 5th paragraph) entity ref 
 * description about warning about unbound entity refs. Entity refs are 
 * always serialized as <code>&amp;foo;</code>, also mention this in the 
 * load part of this spec. 
 * <p> <code>DOMWriter</code>s have a number of named features that can be 
 * queried or set. The name of <code>DOMWriter</code> features must be valid 
 * XML names. Implementation specific features (extensions) should choose an 
 * implementation dependent prefix to avoid name collisions. 
 * <p>Here is a list of features that must be recognized by all 
 * implementations.  Using these features does affect the <code>Node</code> 
 * being serialized, only its serialized form is affected.
