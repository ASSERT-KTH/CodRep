/**
 * This Class <code>DOMInputSourceImpl</code> represents a single input source for an XML entity. 
 * <p> This Class allows an application to encapsulate information about 
 * an input source in a single object, which may include a public 
 * identifier, a system identifier, a byte stream (possibly with a specified 
 * encoding), and/or a character stream. 
 * <p> The exact definitions of a byte stream and a character stream are 
 * binding dependent. 
 * <p> There are two places that the application will deliver this input 
 * source to the parser: as the argument to the <code>parse</code> method, 
 * or as the return value of the <code>DOMEntityResolver.resolveEntity</code>
 *  method. 
 * <p> The <code>DOMBuilder</code> will use the <code>DOMInputSource</code> 
 * object to determine how to read XML input. If there is a character stream 
 * available, the parser will read that stream directly; if not, the parser 
 * will use a byte stream, if available; if neither a character stream nor a 
 * byte stream is available, the parser will attempt to open a URI 
 * connection to the resource identified by the system identifier. 
 * <p> An <code>DOMInputSource</code> object belongs to the application: the 
 * parser shall never modify it in any way (it may modify a copy if 
 * necessary).  Eventhough all attributes in this interface are writable the 
 * DOM implementation is expected to never mutate a DOMInputSource. 
 * <p>See also the <a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-DOM-Level-3-ASLS-20011025'>Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Abstract Schemas and Load
and Save Specification</a>.
