/**
 * A Resource is something that implements IResourceListener and provides a
 * getResource() method which returns the raw IResource to be rendered back to
 * the client browser.
 * <p>
 * Resources themselves do not currently have URLs. Instead, they are referred
 * to by components that have URLs.
 * <p>
 * Resources can be shared throughout an application by adding them to
 * Application with addResource(Class scope, String name) or addResource(String
 * name). A resource added in such a way is a named resource and is accessible
 * throughout the application via Application.getResource(Class scope, String
 * name) or Application.getResource(String name). The ResourceReference class
 * enables easy access to such resources in a way that is light on clusters.
 * <p>
 * While resources can be shared between components, it is important to
 * emphasize that components <i>cannot </i> be shared among containers. For
 * example, you can create a button image resource with new
 * DefaultButtonImageResource(...) and store that in the Application with
 * addResource(). You can then assign that logical resource via ResourceReference
 * to several ImageButton components. While the button image resource can be
 * shared between components like this, the ImageButton components in this
 * example are like all other components in Wicket and cannot be shared.
