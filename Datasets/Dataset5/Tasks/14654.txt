/**
 * Interface to code which gives validation feedback. FeedbackPanel and
 * FormComponentFeedbackBorder both implement this method so they can give the
 * user feedback when a Form fails to validate. But any component can implement
 * the IValidationFeedback interface if it wishes to give the user feedback on
 * form validation.
 * <p>
 * When a form is submitted and one or more validation errors occurs, logic in
 * the Form.handleErrors() method traverses the component hierarchy of the Form
 * being submitted, calling each IValidationFeedback interface it finds.
 * Implementers of the update() method can change their appearance depending on
 * the state of errors in a child component or in the Form as a whole.
