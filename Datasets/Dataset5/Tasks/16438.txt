/**
 * A ZipFileSet is a FileSet with extra attributes useful in the context of 
 * Zip/Jar tasks.
 *
 * A ZipFileSet extends FileSets with the ability to extract a subset of the
 * entries of a Zip file for inclusion in another Zip file.  It also includes
 * a prefix attribute which is prepended to each entry in the output Zip file.
 *
 * At present, ZipFileSets are not surfaced in the public API.  FileSets
 * nested in a Zip task are instantiated as ZipFileSets, and their attributes
 * are only recognized in the context of the the Zip task.
 * It is not possible to define a ZipFileSet outside of the Zip task and
 * refer to it via a refid.  However a standard FileSet may be included by
 * reference in the Zip task, and attributes in the refering ZipFileSet
 * can augment FileSet definition.
