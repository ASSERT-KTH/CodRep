 * A request target is the base entity that is the subject of a request.
 * Different types of request have different request targets. For instance a
 * request for a bookmarkable page differs from a request for a link on a
 * previously rendered page, which in turn differs from a request for a shared
 * resource.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * It is very important (for mounting) that implementations implement
 * {@link java.lang.Object#equals(java.lang.Object)} and
 * {@link java.lang.Object#hashCode()} in a consistent way.
 * </p>
 * Typically, implementations of IRequestTarget are not meant to be used more
 * than once.
