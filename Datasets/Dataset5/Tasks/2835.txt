 * The elemetns can be stored and looked up as IProgramElement(s), in which cases the 
 * element corresponding to the handle is looked up in the containment hierarchy.

 * put/get methods taking IProgramElement as a parameter are for convenience only.  
 * They work identically to calling their counterparts with IProgramElement.getIdentifierHandle()
