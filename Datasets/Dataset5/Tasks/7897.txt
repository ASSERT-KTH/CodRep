/**
 * This abstract string resource loader provides two helper functions to
 * retrieve the message associated with a key, a locale and a style. The simple
 * one uses the <code>Class</code> provided and its parent classes to find the
 * associated message. The more complex one uses in addition the component
 * provided and its parent containers.
 * <p>
 * The component based string resource loader attempts to find the resource from
 * a bundle that corresponds to the supplied component object or one of its
 * parent containers. Generally the component will be an instance of
 * <code>Page</code>, but it may also be an instance of any reusable
 * component that is packaged along with its own resource files. If the
 * component is not an instance of <code>Page</code> then it must be a
 * component that has already been added to a page.
 * <p>
 * The search order for resources is built around the containers that hold the
 * component (if it is not a page). Consider a Page that contains a Panel that
 * contains a Label. If we pass the Label as the component then resource loading
 * will first look for the resource against the page, then against the panel and
 * finally against the label.
 * <p>
 * The above search order may seem slightly odd at first, but can be explained
 * thus: Team A writes a new component X and packages it as a reusable Wicket
 * component along with all required resources. Team B then creates a new
 * container component Y that holds a instance of an X. However, Team B wishes
 * the text to be different to that which was provided with X so rather than
 * needing to change X, they include override values in the resources for Y.
 * Finally, Team C makes use of component Y in a page they are writing.
 * Initially they are happy with the text for Y so they do not include any
 * override values in the resources for the page. However, after demonstrating
 * to the customer, the customer requests the text for Y to be different. Team C
 * need only provide override values against their page and thus do not need to
 * change Y.
 * <p>
 * This implementation is fully aware of both locale and style values when
 * trying to obtain the appropriate resources.
 * <p>
 * In addition to the above search order, each key will be pre-pended with the
 * relative path of the current component related to the component that is being
 * searched. E.g. assume a component hierarchy like page1.form1.input1 and your
 * are requesting a key named 'RequiredValidator'. Wicket will search the property
 * in the following order:
 * <pre>
 *    page1.properties => form1.input1.RequiredValidator
 *    page1.properties => RequiredValidator
 *    form1.properties => input1.RequiredValidator
 *    form1.properties => RequiredValidator
 *    input1.properties => RequiredValidator
 *    myApplication.properties => page1.form1.input1.RequiredValidator
 *    myApplication.properties => RequiredValidator
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * In addition to the above search order, each component that is being searched
 * for a resource also includes the resources from any parent classes that it
 * inherits from. For example, PageA extends CommonBasePage which in turn
 * extends WebPage. When a resource lookup is requested on PageA, the resource
 * bundle for PageA is first checked. If the resource is not found in this
 * bundle then the resource bundle for CommonBasePage is checked. This allows
 * designers of base pages and components to define default sets of string
 * resources and then developers implementing subclasses to either override or
 * extend these in their own resource bundle.
 * <p>
 * You may enable log debug messages for this class to fully understand the
 * search order.
