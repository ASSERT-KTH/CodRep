/**
 * The string resource loader interface allows a strategy pattern to be applied
 * to the loading of resource strings for an application. The loader (or chain
 * of loaders) that are used is configured via the
 * <code>ApplicationSettings</code> class.
 * <p>
 * Each particular implementation of this interface may define its own mechanism
 * for searching for resources. Please see the documents for each particular
 * implementation to determine this behaviour and to see how it can be
 * configured.
 * <p>
 * It is important to note that if a resource is not found by a particular
 * loader then the loader should return <code>null</code> rather than throw an
 * exception. The reason for this is that loaders can be arranged in a chain and
 * it would be very inefficient for loaders earlier in the chain to throw
 * exceptions that must be caught and handled each time until the correct loader
 * in the chain is reached.
