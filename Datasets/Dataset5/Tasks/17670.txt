 * This provide a base class to work with {@link wicket.model.IDetachableModel}.
 * It wraps the actual model objects of components and provides a call back mechanism for
 * reacting on the starting/ ending of a request. doAttach will be called at the first
 * access to this model within a request and - if the model was attached earlier, doDetach
 * will be called at the end of the request. In effect, attachement and detachement is
 * only done when it is actually needed. As the wrapped model object is transient, either
 * attachement should be used to ensure the model onject is again available (after a
 * possible serialization), or extending classes should hold their own instance data
 * representing the model.
