 * A link which can be used exactly like a Button to submit a Form. 
 * The href of the link will use JavaScript to submit the form.

 * <p>You can use this class 2 ways. First with the constructor without a Form object
 * then this Link must be inside a Form so that it knows what form to submit to.
 * Second way is to use the Form constructor then that form will be used to submit to.</p>
