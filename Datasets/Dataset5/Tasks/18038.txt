/**
 * This class provides a mock implementation of a Wicket HTTP based application
 * that can be used for testing. It emulates all of the functionality of an
 * HttpServlet in a controlled, single-threaded environment. It is supported
 * with mock objects for WebSession, HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse
 * and ServletContext.
 * <p>
 * In its most basic usage you can just create a new MockWebApplication. This
 * should be sufficient to allow you to construct components and pages and so on
 * for testing. To use certain features such as localization you must also call
 * setupRequestAndResponse().
 * <p>
 * The application takes an optional path attribute that defines a directory on
 * the disk which will correspond to the root of the WAR bundle. This can then
 * be used for locating non-application resources.
 * <p>
 * To actually test the processing of a particular page or component you can
 * also call processRequestCycle() to do all the normal work of a Wicket
 * request.
 * <p>
 * Between calling setupRequestAndResponse() and processRequestCycle() you can
 * get hold of any of the objects for initialisation. The servlet request object
 * has some handy convenience methods for initialising the request to invoke
 * certain types of pages and components.
 * <p>
 * After completion of processRequestCycle() you will probably just be testing
 * component states. However, you also have full access to the response document
 * (or binary data) and result codes via the servlet response object.
 * <p>
 * IMPORTANT NOTES
 * <ul>
 * <li>This harness is SINGLE THREADED - there is only one global session. For
 * multi-threaded testing you must do integration testing with a full
 * application server.
 * </ul>
