/**
 * A cache to create and maintain {@link PreparedQuery prepared queries}. 
 * 
 * To cache a PreparedQuery is two-stage process. In the first stage, 
 * {@link #register(String, Query, FetchConfiguration)} register} 
 * an identification key and a compiled Query Q to create a 
 * hollow PreparedQuery instance P in the cache. In the second stage, after Q 
 * executes, {@link #initialize(String, Object)} initialize} the hollow 
 * Prepared Query P from the result of execution such as the target
 * database query PQ and its parameters. After initialization, P  can 
 * be used with re-parameterization for subsequent execution of the original 
 * Query Q. 
 * 
 * The target database query PQ associated to a cached prepared query P  
 * <em>may</em> depend upon query execution context such as fetch plan or 
 * lock group. This cache, by design, does not monitor the context or 
 * automatically invalidate an entry P when the original query Q is executed  
 * with context parameters that affect the target query PQ. 
 * 
 * The user must notify this receiver to invalidate a cached entry P when 
 * execution context changes in a way that will modify the resultant database 
 * language query PQ.
 * 
 * One of the built-in mechanism (available in JPA facade) is to set query hints 
 * to either invalidate the query entirely or ignore the cached version for the 
 * current execution. 
 * 
 * @see QueryHints#HINT_IGNORE_PREPARED_QUERY 
 * @see QueryHints#HINT_INVALIDATE_PREPARED_QUERY
 * 
 * This cache allows customization of whether a query can be cached or not
 * via either explicit marking of certain keys as non-cachable (which is 
 * irreversible) or addition/removal of exclusion patterns (which is reversible).
