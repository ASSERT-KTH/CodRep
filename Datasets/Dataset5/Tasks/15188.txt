 * Implementation note: currently we keep this case simple, stupid, and non-generic. In future
 * versions we may revisit this and support removal events (<i>IF</i> removal of validators is
 * ever allowed, which justifies its own discussion). Also, we may look at whether this is a common
 * event to support for {@link IBehavior}s as well. This raises additional questions that need to
 * be answered, hence we'll start by supporting just the use case when validators are added to forms
 * or form components.
