/**
 * Usually you either have a markup file or a xml tag with wicket:id="myComponent" to associate
 * markup with a component. However in some rare cases, especially when working with small panels it
 * is a bit awkward to maintain tiny pieces of markup in plenty of panel markup files. Use cases are
 * for example list views where list items are different depending on a state.
 * <p>
 * Inline panels provide a means to maintain the panels tiny piece of markup in the parents markup
 * file. During the render process, when Wicket iterates over the markup file, the markup fragment
 * must be ignored. It is only indirectly referenced by component.
