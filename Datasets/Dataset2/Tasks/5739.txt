/**
 * Constants and functions relating to DNSSEC (algorithm constants).
 * DNSSEC provides authentication for DNS information.  RRsets are
 * signed by an appropriate key, and a SIG record is added to the set.
 * A KEY record is obtained from DNS and used to validate the signature,
 * The KEY record must also be validated or implicitly trusted - to
 * validate a key requires a series of validations leading to a trusted
 * key.  The key must also be authorized to sign the data.
