 * An instance of <code>ICommand</code> is a handle representing a command as
 * defined by the extension point <code>org.eclipse.ui.commands</code>. The
 * identifier of the handle is identifier of the command being represented.

 * <p>
 * An instance of <code>ICommand</code> can be obtained from an instance of
 * <code>ICommandManager</code> for any identifier, whether or not a command
 * with that identifier defined in the plugin registry.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The handle-based nature of this API allows it to work well with runtime
 * plugin activation and deactivation, which causes dynamic changes to the
 * plugin registry, and therefore, potentially, dynamic changes to the set of
 * command definitions.
