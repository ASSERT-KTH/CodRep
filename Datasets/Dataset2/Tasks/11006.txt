/**
 * Abstract base class for a completion requestor which is passed completion
 * proposals as they are generated in response to a code assist request.
 * <p>
 * This class is intended to be subclassed by clients.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The code assist engine normally invokes methods on completion
 * requestors in the following sequence:
 * <pre>
 * requestor.beginReporting();
 * requestor.accept(proposal_1);
 * requestor.accept(proposal_2);
 * ...
 * requestor.endReporting();
 * </pre>
 * If, however, the engine is unable to offer completion proposals
 * for whatever reason, <code>completionFailure</code> is called
 * with a problem object describing why completions were unavailable.
 * In this case, the sequence of calls is:
 * <pre>
 * requestor.beginReporting();
 * requestor.completionFailure(problem);
 * requestor.endReporting();
 * </pre>
 * In either case, the bracketing <code>beginReporting</code>
 * <code>endReporting</code> calls are always made.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The class was introduced in 3.0 as a more evolvable replacement
 * for the <code>ICompletionRequestor</code> interface.
 * </p>
 * 
 * @see ICodeAssist
 * @since 3.0
