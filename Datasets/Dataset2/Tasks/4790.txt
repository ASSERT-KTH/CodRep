 * <code>Assert</code> is useful for for embedding runtime sanity checks
 * in code. The static predicate methods all test a condition and throw some
 * type of unchecked exception if the condition does not hold.
 * <p>
 * Assertion failure exceptions, like most runtime exceptions, are
 * thrown when something is misbehaving. Assertion failures are invariably
 * unspecified behavior; consequently, clients should never rely on
 * these being thrown (or not thrown). <b>If you find yourself in the
 * position where you need to catch an assertion failure, you have most 
 * certainly written your program incorrectly.</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that an <code>assert</code> statement is slated to be added to the
 * Java language in JDK 1.4, rending this class obsolete.
