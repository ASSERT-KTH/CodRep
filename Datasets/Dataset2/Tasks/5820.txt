/**
 * A page layout defines the initial layout for a page in a workbench window.
 * <p>
 * This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When the workbench needs to create a new page, it uses a perspective to
 * creates a new page layout with a single editor area. This layout is then
 * passed to client code (implementation of
 * <code>IPerspectiveFactory.createInitialLayout</code>) where 
 * additional views can be added, using the existing editor area as the initial
 * point of reference.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Example of populating a layout with standard workbench views:
 * <pre>
 * IPageLayout layout = ...
 * // Get the editor area.
 * String editorArea = layout.getEditorArea();
 *
 * // Top left: Resource Navigator view and Bookmarks view placeholder
 * IFolderLayout topLeft = layout.createFolder("topLeft", IPageLayout.LEFT, 0.25f,
 *    editorArea);
 * topLeft.addView(IPageLayout.ID_RES_NAV);
 * topLeft.addPlaceholder(IPageLayout.ID_BOOKMARKS);
 *
 * // Bottom left: Outline view and Property Sheet view
 * IFolderLayout bottomLeft = layout.createFolder("bottomLeft", IPageLayout.BOTTOM, 0.50f,
 * 	   "topLeft");
 * bottomLeft.addView(IPageLayout.ID_OUTLINE);
 * bottomLeft.addView(IPageLayout.ID_PROP_SHEET);
 *
 * // Bottom right: Task List view
 * layout.addView(IPageLayout.ID_TASK_LIST, IPageLayout.BOTTOM, 0.66f, editorArea);
 * </pre>
 * </p>
