/**
 * Public base class for configuring the workbench.
 * <p>
 * Note that the workbench advisor object is created in advance of creating the
 * workbench. However, by the time the workbench starts calling methods on this
 * class, <code>PlatformUI.getWorkbench</code> is guaranteed to have been
 * properly initialized.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Example of creating and running a workbench (in an
 * <code>IPlatformRunnable</code>):
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * public class MyApplication implements IPlatformRunnable {
 *   public Object run(Object args) {
 *     WorkbenchAdvisor workbenchAdvisor = new MyWorkbenchAdvisor();
 *     Display display = PlatformUI.createDisplay();
 *     int returnCode = PlatformUI.createAndRunWorkbench(display, workbenchAdvisor);
 *     if (returnCode == PlatformUI.RETURN_RESTART) {
 *        return IPlatformRunnable.EXIT_RESTART;
 *     } else {
 *        return IPlatformRunnable.EXIT_OK;
 *   }
 * }
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An application should declare a subclass of <code>WorkbenchAdvisor</code>
 * and override methods to configure the workbench to suit the needs of the
 * particular application.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The following advisor methods are called at strategic points in the
 * workbench's lifecycle (all occur within the dynamic scope of the call
 * to {@link PlatformUI#createAndRunWorkbench PlatformUI.createAndRunWorkbench}):
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>initialize</code> - called first; before any windows; use to
 * register things</li>
 * <li><code>preStartup</code> - called second; after initialize but
 * before first window is opened; use to temporarily disable things during
 * startup or restore</li>
 * <li><code>postStartup</code> - called third; after first window is
 * opened; use to reenable things temporarily disabled in previous step</li>
 * <li><code>postRestore</code> - called after the workbench and its windows
 * has been recreated from a previously saved state; use to adjust the
 * restored workbench</li>
 * <li><code>preWindowOpen</code> - called as each window is being opened; 
 *  use to configure aspects of the window other than actions bars </li>
 * <li><code>fillActionBars</code> - called after <code>preWindowOpen</code> to
 * configure a window's action bars</li>
 * <li><code>postWindowRestore</code> - called after a window has been
 * recreated from a previously saved state; use to adjust the restored
 * window</li>
 * <li><code>postWindowCreate</code> -  called after a window has been created,
 * either from an initial state or from a restored state;  used to adjust the
 * window</li>
 * <li><code>openIntro</code> - called immediately before a window is opened in
 * order to create the introduction component, if any.
 * <li><code>postWindowOpen</code> - called after a window has been
 * opened; use to hook window listeners, etc.</li>
 * <li><code>preWindowShellClose</code> - called when a window's shell
 * is closed by the user; use to pre-screen window closings</li>
 * <li><code>eventLoopException</code> - called to handle the case where the
 * event loop has crashed; use to inform the user that things are not well</li>
 * <li><code>eventLoopIdle</code> - called when there are currently no more
 * events to be processed; use to perform other work or to yield until new
 * events enter the queue</li>
 * <li><code>preShutdown</code> - called just after event loop has terminated
 * but before any windows have been closed; use to deregister things registered
 * during initialize</li>
 * <li><code>postShutdown</code> - called last; after event loop has terminated
 * and all windows have been closed; use to deregister things registered during
 * initialize</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * 
 * @since 3.0
