/**
 * Abstract base implementation of all classpath container initializer.

 * "org.eclipse.jdt.core.classpathContainerInitializer" extension point.
 * <p>
 * Clients should subclass this class to implement a specific classpath
 * container initializer. The subclass must have a public 0-argument
 * constructor and a concrete implementation of <code>resolve</code>.
 * <p>
 * Multiple classpath containers can be registered, each of them declares
 * the container ID they can handle, so as to narrow the set of containers they
 * can resolve, i.e. a container initializer is guaranteed to only be activated to 
 * resolve containers which match the ID they registered onto.
 * <p>
 * In case multiple container initializers collide on the same container ID, the first
 * registered one will be invoked.

     * A container is identified by a container path, which must be formed of two segments.
     * The first segment is used as a unique identifier (which this initializer did register onto), and
     * the second segment can be used as an additional hint when performing the resolution.
     * <p>
     * The initializer is invoked if a container path needs to be resolved for a given project, and no
     * value for it was recorded so far. The implementation of the initializer can set the corresponding 
     * container using <code>JavaCore#setClasspathContainer</code>.

     * 	to be resolved
     * @param project - the Java project in which context the container is to be resolved.
     *    This allows generic containers to be bound with project specific values.
