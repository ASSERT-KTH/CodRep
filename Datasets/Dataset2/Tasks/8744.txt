/** The Argo custom security manager.
 *
 *  Since Argo is an open-source product, the concept of a
 *  security manager may seem odd.  This class is not intended
 *  to provide security in the standard way that Java programmers
 *  think of, in the context of Applets, for example.
 *
 *  Rather, it is intended to protect Argo from accidental modifications
 *  to its own environment by external modules.
 *
 *  One of the areas this is necessary is to protect from the
 *  {@link java.lang.System#exit(int)} or
 *  {@java.lang.Runtime#exit(int)} calls.
 *
 *  Another is to prevent modules from replacing the awt exception
 *  trapping hook so that we are able to properly catch any
 *  ArgoSecurityExceptions and prevent the stack trace when
 *  we desire.
