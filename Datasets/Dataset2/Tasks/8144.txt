/**
 * Abstract base class for plug-ins that integrate with the Eclipse platform UI.
 * <p>
 * Subclasses obtain the following capabilities:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Preferences
 * <ul>
 * <li> The platform core runtime contains general support for plug-in
 *      preferences (<code>org.eclipse.core.runtime.Preferences</code>). 
 *      This class provides appropriate conversion to the older JFace preference 
 *      API (<code>org.eclipse.jface.preference.IPreferenceStore</code>).</li>
 * <li> The method <code>getPreferenceStore</code> returns the JFace preference
 *      store (cf. <code>Plugin.getPluginPreferences</code> which returns
 *      a core runtime preferences object.</li>
 * <li> Subclasses may reimplement <code>initializeDefaultPreferences</code>
 *      to set up any default values for preferences using JFace API. In this
 *      case, <code>initializeDefaultPluginPreferences</code> should not be
 *      overridden.</li>
 * <li> Subclasses may reimplement
 *      <code>initializeDefaultPluginPreferences</code> to set up any default
 *      values for preferences using core runtime API. In this
 *      case, <code>initializeDefaultPreferences</code> should not be
 *      overridden.</li>
 * <li> Preferences are also saved automatically on plug-in shutdown.
 *      However, saving preferences immediately after changing them is
 *      strongly recommended, since that ensures that preference settings
 *      are not lost even in the event of a platform crash.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Dialogs
 * <ul>
 * <li> The dialog store is read the first time <code>getDialogSettings</code> 
 *      is called.</li>
 * <li> The dialog store allows the plug-in to "record" important choices made
 *      by the user in a wizard or dialog, so that the next time the
 *      wizard/dialog is used the widgets can be defaulted to better values. A
 *      wizard could also use it to record the last 5 values a user entered into
 *      an editable combo - to show "recent values". </li>
 * <li> The dialog store is found in the file whose name is given by the
 *      constant <code>FN_DIALOG_STORE</code>. A dialog store file is first
 *      looked for in the plug-in's read/write state area; if not found there,
 *      the plug-in's install directory is checked.
 *      This allows a plug-in to ship with a read-only copy of a dialog store
 *      file containing initial values for certain settings.</li>
 * <li> Plug-in code can call <code>saveDialogSettings</code> to cause settings to
 *      be saved in the plug-in's read/write state area. A plug-in may opt to do
 *      this each time a wizard or dialog is closed to ensure the latest 
 *      information is always safe on disk. </li>
 * <li> Dialog settings are also saved automatically on plug-in shutdown.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Images
 * <ul>
 * <li> A typical UI plug-in will have some images that are used very frequently
 *      and so need to be cached and shared.  The plug-in's image registry 
 *      provides a central place for a plug-in to store its common images. 
 *      Images managed by the registry are created lazily as needed, and will be
 *      automatically disposed of when the plug-in shuts down. Note that the
 *      number of registry images should be kept to a minimum since many OSs
 *      have severe limits on the number of images that can be in memory at once.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * For easy access to your plug-in object, use the singleton pattern. Declare a
 * static variable in your plug-in class for the singleton. Store the first
 * (and only) instance of the plug-in class in the singleton when it is created.
 * Then access the singleton when needed through a static <code>getDefault</code>
 * method.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * See the description on {@link Plugin}.
 * </p>
