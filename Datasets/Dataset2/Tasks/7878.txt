 * Represents a local variable declared in a method or an initializer.
 * <code>ILocalVariable</code> are pseudo-elements created as the result of a <code>ICodeAssist.codeSelect(...)</code>
 * operation. They are not part of the Java model (<code>exists()</code> returns whether the parent exists rather than 
 * whether the local variable exists in the parent) and they are not included in the children of an <code>IMethod</code>

 * In particular such a pseudo-element should not be used as a handle. For example its name range won't be updated
 * if the underlying source changes.
