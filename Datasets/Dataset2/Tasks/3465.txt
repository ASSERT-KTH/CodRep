// Originally MimeHeaders

/**
 * An efficient representation for certain type of map. The keys 
 * can have a single or multi values, but most of the time there are
 * single values.
 *
 * The data is of "MessageBytes" type, meaning bytes[] that can be
 * converted to Strings ( if needed, and encoding is lazy-binded ).
 *
 * This is a base class for MimeHeaders, Parameters and Cookies.
 *
 * Data structures: each field is a single-valued key/value.
 * The fields are allocated when needed, and are recycled.
 * The current implementation does linear search, in future we'll
 * also use the hashkey.
