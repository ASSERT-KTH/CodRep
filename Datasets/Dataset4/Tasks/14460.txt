/**
 * The BoostingQuery class can be used to effectively demote results that match a given query.
 * Unlike the "NOT" clause, this still selects documents that contain undesirable terms,
 * but reduces their overall score:
 * <p/>
 * Query balancedQuery = new BoostingQuery(positiveQuery, negativeQuery, 0.01f);
 * In this scenario the positiveQuery contains the mandatory, desirable criteria which is used to
 * select all matching documents, and the negativeQuery contains the undesirable elements which
 * are simply used to lessen the scores. Documents that match the negativeQuery have their score
 * multiplied by the supplied "boost" parameter, so this should be less than 1 to achieve a
 * demoting effect
