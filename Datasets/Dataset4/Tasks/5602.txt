/**
 * <p>
 * A Stage is a container for {@link Actor}s and handles distributing touch events, animating Actors and asking them to render
 * themselves. A Stage is basically a 2D scenegraph with hierarchies of Actors.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A Stage object fills the whole screen. It has a width and height given in device independent pixels. It will create a
 * {@link Camera} that maps this viewport to the given real screen resolution. If the stretched attribute is set to true then
 * the viewport is enforced no matter the difference in aspect ratio between the stage object and the screen dimensions. In case
 * stretch is disabled then the viewport is extended in the bigger screen dimensions.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Actors have a z-order which is equal to the order they were inserted into this Stage. Actors inserted later will be drawn on
 * top of Actors added earlier. Touch events that will get distributed to later Actors first.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>Actors can get focused. When your game pauses and resumes make sure to call the {@link Stage#unfocusAll()} method so 
 * that the focus states get reset for each pointer id. You also have to make sure that the Actors that were focused reset
 * their state if the depend on being focused, e.g. wait for a touch up event. An easier way to tackle this is to recreate the 
 * Stage if possible.</p>
