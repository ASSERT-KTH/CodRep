/**
 * <p>Constructors annotated with {@code @AssistedInject} indicate that they can be instantiated by
 * the {@link FactoryProvider}. Each constructor must exactly match one corresponding factory method
 * within the factory interface.
 * 
 * <p>Constructor parameters must be either supplied by the factory interface and marked with
 * <code>@Assisted</code>, or they must be injectable.
 * 
 * @deprecated {@link FactoryProvider} now works better with the standard {@literal @Inject}
 *     annotation. When using that annotation, parameters are matched by name and type rather than
 *     by position. In addition, values that use the standard {@literal @Inject} constructor
 *     annotation are eligible for method interception.
