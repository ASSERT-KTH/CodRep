/** Drawable for a {@link NinePatch}.
 * <p>
 * The drawable sizes are set when the ninepatch is set, but they are separate values. Eg, {@link Drawable#getLeftWidth()} could
 * be set to more than {@link NinePatch#getLeftWidth()} in order to provide more space on the left than actually exists in the
 * ninepatch.
 * <p>
 * The min size is set to the ninepatch total size by default. It could be set to the left+right and top+bottom, excluding the
 * middle size, to allow the drawable to be sized down as small as possible.
