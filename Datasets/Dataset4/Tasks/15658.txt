/**
 * An InputListener is used to receive input events from the keyboard and the touch screen (mouse on the desktop). For this
 * it has to be registered with the {@link Input} instance of an {@link Application}. The
 * events might arrive asynchronously in a UI thread, the {@link Input} instance will buffer those events
 * and invoke the methods of the listener in the rendering thread to get rid of the need to synchronize
 * the UI and renderer thread for input. If an InputListener signals that it processed an event by 
 * returning true the event will not be passed to other listeners in the listener chain (multiple
 * InputListeners can register with an Input instance). Note that
 * mouse and touch screen are equivalent here.
