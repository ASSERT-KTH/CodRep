/** <p>
 * An Actor is part of a {@link Stage} or a {@link Group} within a Stage. It has a position, a rectangular size given as width and
 * height, a rotation angle, a scale in x and y and an origin relative to the position which is used for rotation and scaling.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The position of an Actor is coincident with its unrotated, unscaled bottom left corner.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * An Actor can be a child of a Group or the Stage. The object it belongs to is called the Actor's parent. An Actor's position is
 * always relative to the bottom left corner of its parent.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Every Actor must have a unique name within a Stage.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * An Actor can receive touch events when its {@link #touchable} attribute is set to true. The Stage will delegate touch events to
 * an Actor in this case, calling its {@link #touchDown(float, float, int)}, {@link #touchUp(float, float, int)} and
 * {@link #touchDragged(float, float, int)} methods. The coordinates passed to an Actor will be in the Actor's coordinate system,
 * easing the pain of intersection testing. The coordinate system has it's origin at the Actor's rotated and scaled bottom left
 * corner, with the x-axis pointing to the right and the y-axis pointing to the left.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * An Actor can be intersection tested via a call this its {@link #hit(float, float)} method. The coordinates given are again in
 * the Actor's coordinate system.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * An Actor might render itself when its {@link #draw(SpriteBatch, float)} method is called. The projection and transform matrices
 * are setup so that an Actor can simply call the
 * {@link SpriteBatch#draw(com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.Texture, float, float, float, float, float, float, float, float, float, int, int, int, int, boolean, boolean)}
 * method to render himself. Using a {@link Sprite} instance is also an option. An Actor might decide to not render itself at all
 * or chose another way to render itself. For the later it has to call {@link SpriteBatch#end()} first, setup up all render states
 * needed to render itself, render itself and then call {@link SpriteBatch#begin()} again so that the rendering for other Actor's
 * is undisturbed. You have to know what you do if you want to try this.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * An Actor can be controlled by {@link Action}s. An Action will modify some of the attributes of an Actor such as its position or
 * rotation. Actions can be chained and make for rather sophisticated time based behaviour.
 * <p>
