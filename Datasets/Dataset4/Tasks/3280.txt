/**
 * <p>
 * A Font creates glyph bitmaps and stores them in a texture cache. 
 * It has methods to retrieve text metrics to calculate bounds. To
 * render text with a specific Font one has to use a {@link SpriteBatch}
 * instance and it's {@link SpriteBatch.drawText()} method. Once the Font is no longer
 * needed it has to be disposed via the {@link Font.dispose()} method
 * to free all resources.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Fonts must be created by the {@link Graphics.newFont()} methods.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A Font can be managed. In case the OpenGL context is lost all OpenGL resources
 * such as textures get invalidated and have to be reloaded. A Font is basically a
 * texture and is thus also invalidated by a context loss. A context loss happens
 * when a user presses switches to another application or receives an incoming call. This
 * only happens on Android, there are not context losses on the desktop. A managed Font
 * will be reloaded automatically after a context loss so you don't have to do that
 * manually. The drawback: it uses twice the memory for storing the original bitmap
 * from which the texture cache was created. Use this only if you know that you have
 * enough memory available. Future versions will use a different mechanism to get
 * rid of this additional memory overhead.
 * </p>
