/**
 * <p>A Texture wraps a standard OpenGL ES texture.</p> 
 *  
 * <p>It is constructed by an {@link Graphics} via one of the
 * {@link Graphics.newTexture()} methods.</p>
 * 
 * <p>A Texture can be managed. If the OpenGL context is lost
 * all textures get invalidated. This happens when a user switches
 * to another application or receives an incoming call. Managed
 * textures get reloaded automatically. 
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A Texture has to be bound via the {@link Texture.bind()} method in order for it to be applied to geometry.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p> 
 * You can draw {@link Pixmap}s to a texture at any time. The changes will be automatically uploaded to
 * texture memory. This is of course not extremely fast so use it with care.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A Texture must be disposed when it is no longer used
