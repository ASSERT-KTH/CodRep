/**
 * Interface to the input facilities. This allows to poll the state
 * of the keyboard, touch screen and accelerometer. On the desktop
 * the touch screen is replaced by mouse input, the accelerometer is
 * of course not available. Additionally one can register an {@link 
 * InputListener} with this module. The InputListener will then be
 * called each time a key is pressed or released or a touch event occured.
 * The InputListener will be called in the rendering thread of the 
 * graphics module to which a RenderListener is probably attached. This 
 * means that one does not have to take precautions to guarantee thread
 * safety. One can safely call graphics methods from within the InputListener
 * callbacks. One or more InputListeners can be registered with the module.
 * The events will then get passed to the InputListeners in the order they
 * have been registered with the module. If an InputListeners signals that
 * it consumed the event the InputListeners down the chain will not be invoked.
