/**
 * A perspective camera, having a position, a direction an up vector, 
 * a near plane, a far plane and a field of view. Use the {@link PerspectiveCamera.setViewport()}
 * method to set the viewport from which the aspect ratio is derrived from, then 
 * call {@link PerspectiveCamera.update()} to update all the camera matrices as well as the
 * {@link Frustum}. The combined matrix (projection, modelview) can be retrieved via a call 
 * to {@link PerspectiveCamera.getCombinedMatrix()} and directly passed to OpenGL. A convenience
 * method called {@link PerspectiveCamera.setMatrices()} exists for OpenGL ES 1.x that will
 * update the matrices and set them via a {@link Graphics} instance to OpenGL.  
 * You can also get a picking ray via {@link PerspectiveCamera.getPickRay()}.
