 * This interface represents a handler that should be called after

 * some grid points that depend on their own internal algorithm. Once
 * they have found a new grid point (possibly after having computed
 * several evaluation of the derivative at intermediate points), they
 * provide it to objects implementing this interface. These objects
 * typically either ignore the intermediate steps and wait for the
 * last one, store the points in an ephemeris, or forward them to
 * specialized processing or output methods.</p>
