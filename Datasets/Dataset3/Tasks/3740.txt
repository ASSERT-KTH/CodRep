/**
 * This class implements a linear interpolator for step.

 * <p>This interpolator allow to compute dense output inside the last
 * step computed. The interpolation equation is consistent with the
 * integration scheme :

 * <pre>
 *   y(t_n + theta h) = y (t_n + h) - (1-theta) h y'
 * </pre>

 * where theta belongs to [0 ; 1] and where y' is the evaluation of
 * the derivatives already computed during the step.</p>
