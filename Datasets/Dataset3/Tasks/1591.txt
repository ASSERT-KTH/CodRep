/**
 * Note: the visibility of this interface would be reduced to package-private
 * save for an obscure restriction of JDK dynamic proxies.
 * {@link MutableAnnotationUtils#createMutableAnnotation(Class)} creates a proxy based on two
 * interfaces: this one, and whatever annotation is currently being parsed.
 * The restriction is that both interfaces may not be package-private if they
 * are in separate packages.  In order to avoid unnecessarily restricting the
 * visibility options for user-defined annotations, this interface becomes public.
 * Because it is in the internal.* package, it won't pollute the public API, but
 * developers should take caution not to use this annotation outside the
 * internal.parsing.asm package.
