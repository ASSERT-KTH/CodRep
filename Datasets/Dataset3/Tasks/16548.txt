/**
 * A strategy for resolving unique, user destinations per session. User destinations
 * provide a user with the ability to subscribe to a queue unique to their session
 * as well others with the ability to send messages to those queues.
 *
 * <p>For example when a user attempts to subscribe to "/user/queue/position-updates",
 * the destination may be resolved to "/queue/position-updates-useri9oqdfzo" yielding a
 * unique queue name that does not collide with any other user attempting to do the same.
 * Subsequently when messages are sent to "/user/{username}/queue/position-updates",
 * the destination is translated to "/queue/position-updates-useri9oqdfzo".
