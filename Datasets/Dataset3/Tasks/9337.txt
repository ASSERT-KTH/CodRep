/**
 * Convenience subclass of {@link org.springframework.web.servlet.view.UrlBasedViewResolver}
 * that supports {@link TilesView} (i.e. Tiles definitions) and custom subclasses of it.
 *
 * <p>The view class for all views generated by this resolver can be specified
 * via the "viewClass" property. See UrlBasedViewResolver's javadoc for details.
 *
 * <p><b>Note:</b> When chaining ViewResolvers, a TilesViewResolver will
 * check for the existence of the specified template resources and only return
 * a non-null View object if the template was actually found.
