 * Archive output stream implementations are expected to override the

 * <p>
 * The normal sequence of calls for working with ArchiveOutputStreams is:
 * + create ArchiveOutputStream object
 * + write SFX header (optional, Zip only)
 * + repeat as needed:
 *      - putArchiveEntry() (writes entry header)
 *      - write() (writes entry data)
 *      - closeArchiveEntry() (closes entry)
 * + finish() (ends the addition of entries)
 * + write additional data if format supports it (optional)
 * + close()
