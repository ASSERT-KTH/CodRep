/**
 * Indicates that a method produces a bean to be managed by the Spring container. The
 * names and semantics of the attributes to this annotation are intentionally similar
 * to those of the {@literal <bean/>} element in the Spring XML schema. Deviations are
 * as follows:
 * 
 * <p>The Bean annotation does not provide attributes for scope, primary or lazy. Rather,
 * it should be used in conjunction with {@link Scope}, {@link Primary} and {@link Lazy}
 * annotations to acheive the same semantics.
 * 
 * <p>While a {@link #name()} attribute is available, the default strategy for determining
 * the name of a bean is to use the name of the Bean method. This is convenient and
 * intuitive, but if explicit naming is desired, the {@link #name()} attribute may be used.
 * Also note that {@link #name()} accepts an array of strings. This is in order to allow
 * for specifying multiple names (aka aliases) for a single bean.
 * 
 * <h3>Constraints</h3>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Bean methods are valid only when declared within a {@link Configuration}-annotated class
 * 	   <li>Bean methods must be non-void, non-final, non-private
 * 	   <li>Bean methods may not accept any arguments
 *     <li>Bean methods may throw any exception, which will be caught and handled
 *  by the Spring container on processing of the declaring {@link Configuration} class.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <h3>Usage</h3>
 * <p>Bean methods may reference other Bean methods by calling them directly. This ensures
 * that references between beans are strongly typed and navigable. So called 'inter-bean
 * references' are guaranteed to respect scoping and AOP semantics.
