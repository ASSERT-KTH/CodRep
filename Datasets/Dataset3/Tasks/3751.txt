/**
 * This class implements a step interpolator for second order
 * Runge-Kutta integrator.

 * <p>This interpolator allow to compute dense output inside the last
 * step computed. The interpolation equation is consistent with the
 * integration scheme :

 * <pre>
 *   y(t_n + theta h) = y (t_n + h) + (1-theta) h [theta y'_1 - (1+theta) y'_2]
 * </pre>

 * where theta belongs to [0 ; 1] and where y'_1 and y'_2 are the two
 * evaluations of the derivatives already computed during the
 * step.</p>
