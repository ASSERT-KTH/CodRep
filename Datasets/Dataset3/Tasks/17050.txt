/**
 * This class implements Snappy decompression. Snappy is a LZ77-type compressor
 * with a fixed, byte-oriented encoding created by Google(tm). It is originally
 * based on text by Zeev Tarantov. This approach works by allocating a buffer 3x
 * the compression block size. As the stream is decompressed, it is written to
 * the buffer. When the buffer becomes 2/3 full, the first third is flushed to
 * the underlying stream and the following bytes are all shifted down the array.
 * In this way, there is always at least one block-size of buffer available for
 * back-references.
