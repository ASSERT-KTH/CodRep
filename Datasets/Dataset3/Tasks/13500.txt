package org.apache.commons.math.analysis.solvers;

/**
 * Implements the <em>Secant</em> method for root-finding (approximating a
 * zero of a univariate real function). The solution that is maintained is
 * not bracketed, and as such convergence is not guaranteed.
 *
 * <p>Implementation based on the following article: M. Dowell and P. Jarratt,
 * <em>A modified regula falsi method for computing the root of an
 * equation</em>, BIT Numerical Mathematics, volume 11, number 2,
 * pages 168-174, Springer, 1971.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that since release 3.0 this class implements the actual
 * <em>Secant</em> algorithm, and not a modified one. As such, the 3.0 version
 * is not backwards compatible with previous versions. To use an algorithm
 * similar to the pre-3.0 releases, use the
 * {@link IllinoisSolver <em>Illinois</em>} algorithm or the
 * {@link PegasusSolver <em>Pegasus</em>} algorithm.</p>
