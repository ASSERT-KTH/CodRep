/**
 * An interface to classes that implement an algorithm to calculate the
 * Singular Value Decomposition of a real matrix.
 * <p>
 * The Singular Value Decomposition of matrix A is a set of three matrices: U,
 * &Sigma; and V such that A = U &times; &Sigma; &times; V<sup>T</sup>. Let A be
 * a m &times; n matrix, then U is a m &times; p orthogonal matrix, &Sigma; is a
 * p &times; p diagonal matrix with positive or null elements, V is a p &times;
 * n orthogonal matrix (hence V<sup>T</sup> is also orthogonal) where
 * p=min(m,n).
 * </p>
 * <p>This interface is similar to the class with similar name from the
 * <a href="http://math.nist.gov/javanumerics/jama/">JAMA</a> library, with the
 * following changes:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>the <code>norm2</code> method which has been renamed as {@link #getNorm()
 *   getNorm},</li>
 *   <li>the <code>cond</code> method which has been renamed as {@link
 *   #getConditionNumber() getConditionNumber},</li>
 *   <li>the <code>rank</code> method which has been renamed as {@link #getRank()
 *   getRank},</li>
 *   <li>a {@link #getUT() getUT} method has been added,</li>
 *   <li>a {@link #getVT() getVT} method has been added,</li>
 *   <li>a {@link #getSolver() getSolver} method has been added,</li>
 *   <li>a {@link #getCovariance(double) getCovariance} method has been added.</li>
 * </ul>
