/** This interface represents a switching function.
 *
 * <p>A switching function allows to handle discrete events in
 * integration problems. These events occur for example when the
 * integration process should be stopped as some value is reached
 * (G-stop facility), or when the derivatives have
 * discontinuities, or simply when the user wants to monitor some
 * states boundaries crossings. These events are traditionally defined
 * as occurring when a <code>g</code> function sign changes, hence
 * the name <em>switching functions</em>.</p>
 *
 * <p>Since events are only problem-dependent and are triggered by the
 * independant <i>time</i> variable and the state vector, they can
 * occur at virtually any time, unknown in advance. The integrators will
 * take care to avoid sign changes inside the steps, they will reduce
 * the step size when such an event is detected in order to put this
 * event exactly at the end of the current step. This guarantees that
 * step interpolation (which always has a one step scope) is relevant
 * even in presence of discontinuities. This is independent from the
 * stepsize control provided by integrators that monitor the local
 * error (this feature is available on all integrators, including
 * fixed step ones).</p>
