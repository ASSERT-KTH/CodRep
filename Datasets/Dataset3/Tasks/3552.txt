/**
 * This class implements a step interpolator for the 3/8 fourth
 * order Runge-Kutta integrator.

 * <p>This interpolator allows to compute dense output inside the last
 * step computed. The interpolation equation is consistent with the
 * integration scheme :

 * <pre>
 *   y(t_n + theta h) = y (t_n + h)
 *                    - (1 - theta) (h/8) [ (1 - 7 theta + 8 theta^2) y'_1
 *                                      + 3 (1 +   theta - 4 theta^2) y'_2
 *                                      + 3 (1 +   theta)             y'_3
 *                                      +   (1 +   theta + 4 theta^2) y'_4
 *                                        ]
 * </pre>

 * where theta belongs to [0 ; 1] and where y'_1 to y'_4 are the four
 * evaluations of the derivatives already computed during the
 * step.</p>
