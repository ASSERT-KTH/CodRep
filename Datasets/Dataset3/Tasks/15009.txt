/**
 * This class implements a simple Euler integrator for Ordinary
 * Differential Equations.

 * <p>The Euler algorithm is the simplest one that can be used to
 * integrate ordinary differential equations. It is a simple inversion
 * of the forward difference expression :
 * <code>f'=(f(t+h)-f(t))/h</code> which leads to
 * <code>f(t+h)=f(t)+hf'</code>. The interpolation scheme used for
 * dense output is the linear scheme already used for integration.</p>

 * <p>This algorithm looks cheap because it needs only one function
 * evaluation per step. However, as it uses linear estimates, it needs
 * very small steps to achieve high accuracy, and small steps lead to
 * numerical errors and instabilities.</p>

 * <p>This algorithm is almost never used and has been included in
 * this package only as a comparison reference for more useful
 * integrators.</p>
