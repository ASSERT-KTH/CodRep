/** 
 * This class represents measurements in estimation problems.
 *
 * <p>This abstract class implements all the methods needed to handle
 * measurements in a general way. It defines neither the {@link
 * #getTheoreticalValue getTheoreticalValue} nor the {@link
 * #getPartial getPartial} methods, which should be defined by
 * sub-classes according to the specific problem.</p>
 *
 * <p>The {@link #getTheoreticalValue getTheoreticalValue} and {@link
 * #getPartial getPartial} methods must always use the current
 * estimate of the parameters set by the solver in the problem. These
 * parameters can be retrieved through the {@link
 * EstimationProblem#getAllParameters
 * EstimationProblem.getAllParameters} method if the measurements are
 * independent of the problem, or directly if they are implemented as
 * inner classes of the problem.</p>
 *
 * <p>The instances for which the <code>ignored</code> flag is set
 * through the {@link #setIgnored setIgnored} method are ignored by the
 * solvers. This can be used to reject wrong measurements at some
 * steps of the estimation.</p>
