/**
 * Simple implementation of ViewResolver that interprets a view name
 * as bean name in the current application context, i.e. in the XML
 * file of the executing DispatcherServlet.
 *
 * <p>This resolver can be handy for small applications, keeping all
 * definitions ranging from controllers to views in the same place.
 * For normal applications, XmlViewResolver will be the better choice, as
 * it separates the XML view bean definitions into a dedicated views file.
 * View beans should virtually never have references to any other
 * application beans - such a separation will make this clear.
 *
 * <p>This ViewResolver does not support internationalization.
 * Conside ResourceBundleViewResolver if you need to apply different
 * view resources per locale.
 *
 * <p>Note: This ViewResolver implements the Ordered interface to allow for
 * flexible participation in ViewResolver chaining. For example, some special
 * views could be defined via this ViewResolver (giving it 0 as "order" value),
 * while all remaining views could be resolved by a UrlBasedViewResolver.
