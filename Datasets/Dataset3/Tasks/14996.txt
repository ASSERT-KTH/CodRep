/**
 * Interface used when dynamically creating mutable instances of annotations associated
 * with {@link Configuration} class processing. This functionality is necessary given
 * that parsing of Configuration classes is done with ASM. Annotation metadata (including
 * attributes) is parsed from the class files, and instances of those annotations are
 * then created using this interface and its associated utilities. The annotation
 * instances are attached to the configuration model objects at runtime, namely
 * {@link ConfigurationClassMethod}. This approach is better than the alternative of
 * creating fine-grained model representations of all annotations and attributes.
 * It is better to simply attach annotation instances and read them as needed.
