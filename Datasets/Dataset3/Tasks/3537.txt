/**
 * This class implements a step interpolator for the Gill fourth
 * order Runge-Kutta integrator.

 * <p>This interpolator allows to compute dense output inside the last
 * step computed. The interpolation equation is consistent with the
 * integration scheme :

 * <pre>
 *   y(t_n + theta h) = y (t_n + h)
 *                    - (1 - theta) (h/6) [ (1 - theta) (1 - 4 theta) y'_1
 *                                        + (1 - theta) (1 + 2 theta) ((2-q) y'_2 + (2+q) y'_3)
 *                                        + (1 + theta + 4 theta^2) y'_4
 *                                        ]
 * </pre>
 * where theta belongs to [0 ; 1], q = sqrt(2) and where y'_1 to y'_4
 * are the four evaluations of the derivatives already computed during
 * the step.</p>
