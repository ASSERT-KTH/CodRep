/** This class implements simplex-based direct search optimization
 * algorithms.

 * <p>Direct search methods only use cost function values, they don't
 * need derivatives and don't either try to compute approximation of
 * the derivatives. According to a 1996 paper by Margaret H. Wright
 * (<a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/doc/96/4-02.ps.gz">Direct
 * Search Methods: Once Scorned, Now Respectable</a>), they are used
 * when either the computation of the derivative is impossible (noisy
 * functions, unpredictable dicontinuities) or difficult (complexity,
 * computation cost). In the first cases, rather than an optimum, a
 * <em>not too bad</em> point is desired. In the latter cases, an
 * optimum is desired but cannot be reasonably found. In all cases
 * direct search methods can be useful.</p>

 * <p>Simplex-based direct search methods are based on comparison of
 * the cost function values at the vertices of a simplex (which is a
 * set of n+1 points in dimension n) that is updated by the algorithms
 * steps.</p>

 * <p>Minimization can be attempted either in single-start or in
 * multi-start mode. Multi-start is a traditional way to try to avoid
 * being trapped in a local minimum and miss the global minimum of a
 * function. It can also be used to verify the convergence of an
 * algorithm. The various multi-start-enabled <code>minimizes</code>
 * methods return the best minimum found after all starts, and the
 * {@link #getMinima getMinima} method can be used to retrieve all
 * minima from all starts (including the one already provided by the
 * {@link #minimizes(CostFunction, int, ConvergenceChecker, double[],
 * double[]) minimizes} method).</p>

 * <p>This class is the base class performing the boilerplate simplex
 * initialization and handling. The simplex update by itself is
 * performed by the derived classes according to the implemented
 * algorithms.</p>
