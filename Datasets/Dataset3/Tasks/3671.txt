   * themselves only if they need them. This method triggers these
   * extra evaluations. It can be called directly by the user step
   * handler and it is called automatically if {@link
   * #setInterpolatedTime} is called.</p>

   * <p>Once this method has been called, <strong>no</strong> other
   * evaluation will be performed on this step. If there is a need to
   * have some side effects between the step handler and the
   * differential equations (for example update some data in the
   * equations once the step has been done), it is advised to call
   * this method explicitly from the step handler before these side
   * effects are set up. If the step handler induces no side effect,
   * then this method can safely be ignored, it will be called
   * transparently as needed.</p>

   * <p><strong>Warning</strong>: since the step interpolator provided
   * to the step handler as a parameter of the {@link
   * StepHandler#handleStep handleStep} is valid only for the duration
   * of the {@link StepHandler#handleStep handleStep} call, one cannot
   * simply store a reference and reuse it later. One should first
   * finalize the instance, then copy this finalized instance into a
   * new object that can be kept.</p>

   * <p>This method calls the protected <code>doFinalize</code> method
   * if it has never been called during this step and set a flag
   * indicating that it has been called once. It is the <code>
   * doFinalize</code> method which should perform the evaluations.
   * This wrapping prevents from calling <code>doFinalize</code> several
   * times and hence evaluating the differential equations too often.
   * Therefore, subclasses are not allowed not reimplement it, they
   * should rather reimplement <code>doFinalize</code>.</p>
