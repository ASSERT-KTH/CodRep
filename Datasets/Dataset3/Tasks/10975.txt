/** This class represents range of non null elements for rows or
 * columns of matrices.

 * <p>This class is used to reduce the computation loops by avoiding
 * using elements that are known to be zeros. For full matrices, the
 * range simply spans from 0 to the order of the matrix. For lower and
 * upper triangular matrices, its width will depend on the index of
 * the row or column considered. For diagonal matrices, the range is
 * reduced to one index.</p>

 * <p>The indices provided by the class correspond to the elements
 * that are non-null only according to the <emph>structure</emph> of
 * the matrix. The real value of the element is not
 * considered. Consider for example the following lower triangular
 * matrix :</p>

 * <pre>
 *   1 0 0 0
 *   2 8 0 0
 *   0 5 3 0
 *   3 2 4 4
 * </pre>

 * <p>The third rows begins with zero, but this is not a consequence
 * of the lower triangular structure, it is only a
 * coincidence. Therefore, the range (in row/columns count)
 * corresponding to third row will span from 0 to 2, not from 1 to 2.</p>
