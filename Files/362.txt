/**
	Any object that implements this interface can be used as a locking
	policy for accessing a container. 
	<P>
	The locking policy must use the defined lock qualifiers 
    (ContainerLock.CIS, RowLock.RS, etc.) and the standard lock manager.
    (A locking policy that just performs no locking wouldn't need to use 
    these :-)
	<P>
	A locking policy must use the object that is an instance of Transaction
    (originally obtained via startTransaction() in RawStoreFactory) as the 
    compatibilitySpace for the LockFactory calls.
	<BR>
	A locking policy must use the passed in transaction as the 
    compatability space and the lock group.
	This chain (group) of locks has the following defined behaviour
		<UL>
		<LI>Locks are released at transaction.commit()
		<LI>Locks are released at transaction.abort()
		</UL>
